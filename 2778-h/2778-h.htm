    <h3>
      THE NEW COACHMAN
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you polish up those buckles real good, won't you, 'Zekiel? I will say
      for Fanshaw, you could most see your face in the harness always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow addressed rubbed away at the nickel plating good
      humoredly, although he had heard enough exhortations in the last
      twenty-four hours to chafe somewhat the spirit of youth. His mother, a
      large, heavy woman, stood over him, her face full of care.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a big change from driving a grocery wagon to driving a gentleman's
      carriage, 'Zekiel. I do hope you sense it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd make a bronze image sense it, mother,&rdquo; answered the young man,
      smiling broadly. &ldquo;You might sit and sermonize just as well, mightn't you?
      Sitting's as cheap as standing,&rdquo;&mdash;he cast a glance around the clean
      spaces of the barn in search of a chair,&mdash;&ldquo;or if you'd rather go and
      attend to your knitting, I've seen harness before, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not sure as you've ever handled a gentleman's harness in your life,
      'Zekiel Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a fact they don't wear 'em much down Boston way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His mother regarded his shock of light hair with repressed fondness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a big responsibility I took when I asked Mr. Evringham to let you
      try the place,&rdquo; she said solemnly, &ldquo;and I'm going to do my best to help
      you fill it. It does seem almost a providence the way Fanshaw's livery
      fits you; and if you'll hold yourself up, I may be partial, but it seems
      to me you look better in it than he ever did; and I'm sure if handsome is
      as handsome does, you'll fill it better every way, even if he <i>was</i> a
      fashionable English coachman. Mrs. Evringham was so pleased with his style
      she tried to have him kept even after he'd taken too much for the second
      time; but Mr. Evringham valued his horses too highly for that, I can tell
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought the governor was a widower still,&rdquo; remarked Ezekiel as his mother
      drew forward a battered chair and dusted it with the huge apron that
      covered her neat dress. She seated herself close to her boy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he is,&rdquo; she returned with some asperity. &ldquo;Why should he get
      married with such a home as he's got? Fifteen years I've kept house for
      Mr. Evringham. I don't believe but what he'd say that in all that time
      he's never found his beef overdone or a button off his shirts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; grunted Ezekiel. &ldquo;He looks as if he wouldn't mind hanging you to
      the nearest tree if he did. I heard tell once that there was a cold hell
      as well as a hot one. Think says I, when the governor was looking me over
      the other day, 'You've set sail for the cold place, old boy.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeke Forbes, don't you ever let me hear you say such a thing again!&rdquo;
       exclaimed Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;Mr. Evringham is the finest gentleman within one
      hundred miles of New York city. When a man has spent his life in Wall
      Street it's bound to show some in his face, of course; but what comfort
      has that man ever known?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty scrumptious place he's got here in this park, I notice,&rdquo; returned
      the new coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he has a breath of fresh air before he goes to the city and after he
      gets back every day. Isn't that Essex Maid of his a beauty?&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes
      cast her eyes towards the stalls where the shining flanks of two horses
      were visible from her seat by the wide-open doors of the barn. &ldquo;His rides
      back there among the hills,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Forbes waved her hand vaguely
      toward the tall trees waving in the spring sunshine,&mdash;&ldquo;are his one
      pleasure; and he never tires of them. You will find the horses here
      something different to groom from those common grocery horses in Boston.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; drawled 'Zekiel, teasingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'd better know, young man,&rdquo; emphatically. &ldquo;And, Zeke, what's the
      names of those carriages?&rdquo; pointing with sudden energy at two half
      shrouded vehicles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many guesses do I get?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guessing ain't going to do. Do you know, or don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know? Why,&rdquo; leniently, &ldquo;bless your heart, mother, don't you s'pose I know
      a buggy and a carryall when I see 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you poor benighted grocery boy!&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes raised her hands. &ldquo;What
      a mercy I mentioned it! Imagine Mrs. Evringham hearing you ask if she'd
      have the buggy or the carryall! 'Zekiel,&rdquo; solemnly, &ldquo;listen to me. That
      tall one's a spider, and the other's a broom. There! Do you hear me? A <i>spider</i>
      and a <i>broom</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel's merry eyes met the anxious ones with a twinkle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who'd have thought it!&rdquo; he responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Zeke,&rdquo; anxiously, &ldquo;it's my responsibility. I recommended you. I
      want you should say 'em off as glib as Fanshaw did. Now then, which is
      which?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, didn't you tell me that the late lamented was not a
      prohibitionist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fanshaw drank like a fish, if that's what you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, just because he saw things in this barn you needn't expect me to!
      Poor chap! Spiders and brooms! He must have been glad to go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes' earnest expression did not change. &ldquo;'Zekiel, don't you tease,
      now! We haven't got time. I want you to make such a success of this that
      you'll stay with me. You can't think how I felt when I woke up this
      morning and thought the first thing, 'Zeke's here.' Why, I've scarcely
      kept acquainted with you for fifteen years. Scarcely saw you except for a
      few weeks in the summer time. Now I've got you again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't the only thing you've got again,&rdquo; grinned 'Zekiel, &ldquo;if you're
      going to see things, same as Fanshaw did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus reminded, the housekeeper looked back at the phaeton and the
      brougham. &ldquo;Be a good boy, Zeke,&rdquo; coaxingly, &ldquo;and don't forget now, because
      Mrs. Evringham is a great stickler&mdash;and a great sticker, too,&rdquo; added
      Mrs. Forbes in a different tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who <i>is</i> the old woman, if the governor isn't married?&rdquo; asked
      Ezekiel with not very lively interest. &ldquo;She don't seem popular with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll tell you who she is,&rdquo; returned his mother in a low, emphatic tone.
      &ldquo;she's just what I say&mdash;a sticker and an interloper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! Shouldn't wonder if the green-eyed monster had got after mamma,&rdquo;
       soliloquized the youth aloud. &ldquo;Somebody else sews on the buttons now,
      perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Zekiel Forbes, we must have an understanding right off. You've got to
      joke and tease, I s'pose, but it can't be about Mr. Evringham. This is
      like a law of the Medes and Persians, and I want you should understand it.
      The more you see of him the less you'll dare to joke about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you he scared me stiff,&rdquo; acknowledged Zeke, running the harness
      through his hands to discover another dingy spot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he'd <i>better</i>. Now I wouldn't gossip to you of my employer's
      affairs&mdash;I hope we're better than two common servants&mdash;but I
      want you to be as loyal to him as I am, and to understand a few of the
      reasons why he can't go giggling around like some folks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott!&rdquo; interpolated the young coachman. &ldquo;Mr. Evringham go giggling
      around! So would Bunker Hill monument!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Zeke. Mr. Evringham has had two sons. His wife died when
      the oldest, Lawrence, was fifteen. Well, both those boys disappointed him.
      Lawrence when he was twenty-one married secretly a widow older than
      himself, who had a little girl named Eloise. Mr. Evringham made the best
      of it, and helped him along in business. Lawrence became a broker and had
      made and lost a fortune when he died at the age of thirty-five.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Broke himself, did he?&rdquo; remarked the irrepressible 'Zekiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he did. Here we were, living in peace and comfort,&mdash;my employer
      at sixty a man of settled habits and naturally very set in his ways and
      satisfied with his home and the way I had run it for him for fifteen
      years,&mdash;when three blows fell on him at once. Firstly his son
      Lawrence failed and was ruined; secondly he died; and thirdly his widow
      and her daughter nineteen years old came here a couple of months ago and
      settled on Mr. Evringham, and here they've stayed ever since! I don't
      think they have an idea of going away.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes's eyes snapped. &ldquo;Such
      an upset as it was! I couldn't show how I felt, of course, for it was so
      much worse for him than it was for me. He had never cared for Mrs.
      Evringham, and scarcely knew the girl who called him 'grandfather' without
      an atom of right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hard lines,&rdquo; observed 'Zekiel. &ldquo;Does the girl call herself Evringham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she?&rdquo; with scorn. &ldquo;Well I guess she does. Of course she was only
      four when her mother married Lawrence, and I guess she was fond of her
      stepfather and he of her, because he never had any children; but sometimes
      I ask myself, is it going on forever? I only hope Eloise'll get married
      soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Zekiel dropped the harness to arrange imaginary curls on his temples and
      pat the tie on his muscular neck. &ldquo;If she's pretty I'm willing,&rdquo; he
      responded.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother shook her head absently. &ldquo;Then there was Mr. Evringham's
      younger son, a regular roving ne'er-do-well. He didn't like Wall Street
      and he went West to Chicago. He was a rolling stone, first in one position
      and then in another; then he got married, and after a few years he rolled
      away altogether. All Mr. Evringham knows about him and his family is that
      he had one child. Harry wrote a few letters about his wife Julia and the
      baby, at the time it was born, and Mr. Evringham sent a present of money;
      then the letters ceased until one day the wife wrote him frantically that
      her husband had disappeared and begged to know where he was. Mr. Evringham
      knew nothing about him and wrote her so, and that is the last he's heard.
      So you see if he looks cold and hard, he's had enough to make him so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm!&rdquo; ejaculated 'Zekiel. &ldquo;He don't give the impression of lyin' awake
      nights wondering how his deserted daughter-in-law and the kid make out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he?&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Forbes sharply. &ldquo;His two boys acted as
      selfish to him as boys could. He's a disappointed, humiliated man in that
      proud heart of his. He's been hunted out and harrowed up in this peaceful
      retreat, when all he asked was to be let alone with his horses and his
      golf clubs, and I think one daughter-in-law's enough under the
      circumstances. I have some respect for Mrs. Harry, whoever she is, because
      she lets him alone. In all the long years we've spent here, when he often
      had no one to talk to but me, he's let me have a glimpse of these things,
      and I've told you so's you'd think right about him and serve him all the
      better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got a look in his eyes like cold steel,&rdquo; remarked Ezekiel, &ldquo;and
      lines under 'em like they'd been drawn with steel; and his back's as flat
      and straight as if a steel rod took the place of a spine. That thick gray
      hair and mustache of his might be steel threads.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's a splendid sight on horseback,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Forbes devoutly. &ldquo;His
      sons were neither of 'em ever the man he is. I'd like to protect him from
      being imposed upon if such a thing was possible.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sho!&rdquo; drawled 'Zekiel. &ldquo;Might's well talk about protecting a battleship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, 'Zekiel Forbes,&rdquo; returned his mother, her eyes bright, &ldquo;can't you
      imagine a battleship hesitating to run down a little pleasure yacht with
      all its flags flying? And can't you imagine that hesitation costing the
      battleship considerable precious time and money? You've said a good deal
      about my sacrificing my room in the house and coming out here to fix a
      little home for us both, upstairs in the barn chambers, but perhaps you
      can see now that it isn't all sacrifice, that perhaps I'm glad of an
      excuse to get out of the house, where things are so different from what
      they used to be, and to have a cosy home with my own boy. Now then,
      'Zekiel,&rdquo; coaxingly, these words recalling her boy's responsibilities,
      &ldquo;look over there once more and tell me which of those is the spider.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zekiel dropped the harness and laid his hand gently on his mother's
      forehead. &ldquo;There isn't anything there, dear mother,&rdquo; he said soothingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeke!&rdquo; she exclaimed, jerking away with a short reluctant laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Mother, dear mother, come home with me now,'&rdquo; he roared sentimentally,
      so that Essex Maid lifted her beautiful head and looked out in surprise.
      &ldquo;Remember Fanshaw, and put more water in it after this,&rdquo; he added,
      dropping his arm to his mother's neck and capturing her with a hug.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Zekiel!&rdquo; she protested. &ldquo;'Zekiel!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER II
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE CHICAGO LETTER
    </h3>
    <p>
      The mother was still laughing and struggling in the irresistible embrace
      when both became aware that a third person was regarding them in
      open-mouthed astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Zekiel, let me <i>go</i>!&rdquo; commanded the scandalized woman, and pushed
      herself free from her tormentor, who forthwith returned rather sheepishly
      to his buckles.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man with trim-pointed beard and mirthful eyes, who stood in the
      driveway, had just dismounted from a shining buggy. Doubt and astonishment
      were apparently holding him dumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper, smoothing her disarranged locks and much flushed of face,
      returned his gaze, rising from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't believe it was you, Mrs. Forbes!&rdquo; declared the newcomer.
      &ldquo;Fanshaw isn't&mdash;&rdquo; He looked around vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he isn't, Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes shortly. &ldquo;He forgot to
      rub down Essex Maid one evening when she came in hot, and that finished
      him with Mr. Evringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young doctor's lips twitched beneath his mustache as he looked at
      'Zekiel, polishing away for dear life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to have some one else here&mdash;some friend,&rdquo; he remarked
      tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Friend!&rdquo; echoed the housekeeper with exasperation, feeling to see just
      how much Zeke had rumpled her immaculate collar. &ldquo;We looked like friends
      when you came up, didn't we!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like intimate friends,&rdquo; murmured the doctor, still looking curiously at
      the big fair-haired fellow, who was crimson to his temples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know how long we shall continue friends if he ever grabs me again
      like that just after I've put on a clean collar. He's got beyond the place
      where I can correct him. I ought to have done it oftener when I had the
      chance. This is my boy 'Zekiel, Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; with a proud glance in the
      direction of the youth, who looked up and nodded, then continued his
      labors. &ldquo;Mr. Evringham has engaged him on trial. He's been with horses a
      couple of years, and I guess he'll make out all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to know you, 'Zekiel,&rdquo; returned the doctor. &ldquo;Your mother has been a
      good friend of mine half my life, and I've often heard her speak of you.
      Look out for my horse, will you? I shall be here half an hour or so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor had moved off toward the house Mrs. Forbes nodded at her
      son knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Might's well walk Hector into the barn and uncheck him, Zeke,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;They'll keep him more'n a half an hour. That young man, 'Zekiel Forbes,&mdash;that
      young man's my <i>hope</i>.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes spoke impressively and shook her
      forefinger to emphasize her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you hoping about him?&rdquo; asked 'Zekiel, laying down the harness and
      proceeding to lead the gray horse up the incline into the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't wonder a mite if he was our deliverer,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;I
      saw it in Mrs. Evringham's eye that he suited her, the first night that
      she met him here at dinner. I like him first-rate, and I don't mean him
      any harm; but he's one of these young doctors with plenty of money at his
      back, bound to have a fashionable practice and succeed. His face is in his
      favor, and I guess he knows as much as any of 'em, and he can afford the
      luxury of a wife brought up the way Eloise Evringham has been. That's
      right, Zeke. Unfasten the check-rein, though the doctor don't use a mean
      one, I must say. I only hope there's a purgatory for the folks that use
      too short check-reins on their horses. I hope they'll have to wear 'em
      themselves for a thousand years, and have to stand waiting at folks' doors
      frothing at the mouth, and the back of their necks half breaking when the
      weather's down to zero and up to a hundred. That's what I hope!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Zekiel grinned. &ldquo;You want 'em to try the cold place and the hot one too,
      do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes I do, and to stay in the one that hurts the most. The man that uses a
      decent check-rein on his horse,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Forbes, dropping into a
      philosophizing tone, &ldquo;is apt to be as decent to his wife. The doctor would
      be a great catch for that girl, and I <i>think</i>,&rdquo; dropping her voice,
      &ldquo;her mother'd be liable to live with 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're keeping that dark from the doctor, I s'pose?&rdquo; remarked 'Zekiel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. You needn't think I go chattering around that house the way I do out
      here. I've got a great talent, if I do say it, for minding my own
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good enough,&rdquo; drawled 'Zekiel. &ldquo;I heard tell once of a firm that made a
      great fortune just doing that one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you be sassy now. I've always waited on Mr. Evringham while he ate
      his meals, and that's the time he'd often speak out to me about things if
      he felt in the humor, so that in all these years 't isn't any wonder if
      I've come to feel that his business is mine too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just so,&rdquo; returned 'Zekiel, with a twinkle in his eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's been as plain as your nose that the interlopers don't like to have
      me there. Not that they have anything special against me, but they'd like
      to have someone younger and stylisher to hand them their plates. I'll
      never forget one night when they'd been here about a week, and I think Mr.
      Evringham had begun to suspect they were fixtures,&mdash;I'd felt it from
      the first,&mdash;Mrs. Evringham said, 'Why father, does Mrs. Forbes always
      wait on your table? I had supposed she was temporarily taking the place of
      your butler or your waitress.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper's effort to imitate the airy manner she remembered caused
      her son to chuckle as he gathered up the shining harness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You should have seen the look Mr. Evringham gave her. Just as if he
      didn't see her at all. 'Yes,' he answered, 'I hope Mrs. Forbes will wait
      on my table as long as I have one.' And I will if I have my health,&rdquo; added
      the speaker, bridling with renewed pleasure at the memory of that
      triumphant moment. &ldquo;They think I'm a machine without any feelings or
      opinions, and that I've been wound up to suit Mr. Evringham and run his
      establishment, and that I'm no more to be considered than the big
      Westminster clock on the stairs. Mrs. Evringham did try once to get into
      my employer's rooms and look after his clothes.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes shook her
      head and tightened her lips at some recollection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She bucked up against the machine, did she?&rdquo; inquired Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper glanced around to see if any one might be approaching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw her go in there, and I followed her,&rdquo; she continued almost in a
      whisper. &ldquo;She sort of started, but spoke up in her cool way, 'I wish to
      look over father's clothes and see if anything needs attention.' 'Thank
      you, Mrs. Evringham, but everything is in order,' I said, very respectful.
      'Well, leave it for me next time, Mrs. Forbes,' she says. 'I shall take
      care of him while I am here.' 'Thank you,' says I, 'but he wouldn't want
      your visit interfered with by that kind of work.' She looked at me sort of
      suspicious and haughty. 'I prefer to do it,' she answers, trying to look
      holes in me with her big eyes. 'Then will you ask him, please,' said I
      very polite, 'before I give you the keys, because we've got into habits
      here. I've taken care of Mr. Evringham's clothes for fifteen years.' She
      looked kind of set back. 'Is it so long?' she asks. 'Well, I will see
      about it.' But I guess the right time for seeing about it never came,&rdquo;
       added the housekeeper knowingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're still doing business at the old stand, eh?&rdquo; rejoined Zeke. &ldquo;Well,
      I'm glad you like your job. It's my opinion that the governor's harder&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ahem, ahem!&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes cleared her throat with desperate loudness and
      tugged at her son's shirt sleeve with an energy which caused him to wheel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming up the sunny driveway was a tall man with short, scrupulously
      brushed iron-gray hair, and sweeping mustache. The lines under his eyes
      were heavy, his glance was cold. His presence was dignified, commanding,
      repellent.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper and coachman both stood at attention, the latter
      mechanically pulling down his rolled-up sleeves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you're moving out here, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; was the remark with which the
      newcomer announced himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Mr. Evringham. The man has been here to put in the electric bell you
      ordered. I shall be as quick to call as if I was still in the house, sir,
      and I thank you&mdash;'Zekiel and I both do&mdash;for consenting to my
      making it home-like for him. Perhaps you'd come up and see the rooms,
      sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not just now. Some other time. I hope 'Zekiel is going to prove himself
      worth all this trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The new coachman's countenance seemed frozen into a stolidity which did
      not alter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure he'll try,&rdquo; replied his mother, &ldquo;and Fanshaw's livery fits him
      to such a turn that it would have been flying in the face of Providence
      not to try him. Did you give orders to be met at this train, sir?&rdquo; Mrs.
      Forbes looked anxiously toward the set face of her heir.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;I came out unexpectedly. I have received news that is rather
      perplexing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper had not studied her employer's moods for years without
      understanding when she could be of use.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will come to the house right off,&rdquo; was her prompt response. &ldquo;It's a
      pity you didn't know the bell was in, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, stay where you are. I see Dr. Ballard is here. We might be
      interrupted. You can go, 'Zekiel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow needed no second invitation, but turned and mounted the
      stairway that led to the chambers above.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham took from his pocket a bunch of papers, and selecting a
      letter handed it to Mrs. Forbes, motioning her to the battered chair,
      which was still in evidence. He seated himself on the stool Zeke had
      vacated, while his housekeeper opened and read the following letter:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      CHICAGO, April 28, 19&mdash;.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR FATHER,&mdash;The old story of the Prodigal Son has always plenty of
      originality for the Prodigal. I have returned, and thank Heaven sincerely
      I do not need to ask you for anything. My blessed girl Julia has supported
      herself and little Jewel these years while I've been feeding on husks. I
      don't see now how I was willing to be so revoltingly cruel and cowardly as
      to leave her in the lurch, but she has made friends and they have stood by
      her, and now I've been back since September, doing all in my power to make
      up what I can to her and Jewel, as we call little Julia. They were
      treasures to return to such as I deserved to have lost forever; but Julia
      treats me as if I'd been white to her right all along. I've lately secured
      a position that I hope to keep. My wife has been dressmaking, and this is
      something in the dry goods line that I got through her. The firm want us
      to go to Europe to do some buying. They will pay the expenses of both; but
      that leaves Jewel. I've heard that Lawrence's wife and daughter are living
      with you. I wondered if you'd let us bring Jewel as far as New York and
      drop her with you for the six weeks that we shall be gone. If we had a
      little more ahead we'd take the child with us. She is eight years old and
      wouldn't be any trouble, but cash is scarce, and although we could board
      her here with some friend, I'd like to have her become acquainted with her
      grandfather, and I thought as Madge and Eloise were with you, they would
      look after her if Mrs. Forbes is no longer there. This has all come about
      very suddenly, and we sail next Wednesday on the Scythia, so I'll be much
      obliged if you will wire me. I shall be glad to shake your hand again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your repentant son,
    </p>
    <p>
      HARRY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes looked up from the letter to find her employer's eyes upon
      her. Her lips were set in a tight line.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to ask first, sir, what you think of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me as very cool. Harry knows my habits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper loosened the reins of her indignation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea of your having a child here to clatter up and down the stairs at
      the very time you want to take a nap!&rdquo; she burst forth. &ldquo;You've had enough
      to bear already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A deal of company in the house as it is, eh?&rdquo; he rejoined. It was the
      first reference he had ever made to his permanent guests.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's what I was thinking, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not for it, then, Mrs. Forbes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far as taking care of the child goes, I should do my duty. I don't
      think Mrs. Evringham or her daughter would wish to be bothered; but I know
      very little about children, except that your house is no place for them to
      be racing in. One young one brings others. You would be annoyed, sir. Some
      folks can always ask favors.&rdquo; The housekeeper's cheeks were flushed with
      the strength of her repugnance, and her bias relieved Mr. Evringham's
      indecision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agree with you,&rdquo; he returned, rising. &ldquo;Tell 'Zekiel to saddle the Maid.
      After dinner I will let him take a telegram to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned to the house without further words, and Mrs. Forbes called to
      her son in a voice that had a wrathful quaver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you got your back up about?&rdquo; inquired Zeke softly, after a careful
      look to see that his august master had departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind. Mr. Evringham wants you should saddle his horse and bring
      her round. I want he should see you can do it lively.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain't she a beaut'!&rdquo; exclaimed Zeke as he led out the mare. &ldquo;She'd ought
      to be shown, she had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shown! Better not expose your ignorance where Mr. Evringham can hear you.
      That mare's taken two blue ribbons already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Showed they knew their business,&rdquo; returned Zeke imperturbably. &ldquo;I s'pose
      the old gent don't care any more for her than he does for his life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he loves her the best of anything in this world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love! The governor love anything or anybody! That's good,&rdquo; remarked the
      young fellow, while Essex Maid watched his movements about her with
      gentle, curious eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe she misses Fanshaw and notices the difference,&rdquo; remarked
      Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to, too. Ain't you, my beauty? She's going to be stuck on me before
      we get through. She don't want any Britishers fooling around her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've certainly made her look fine, Zeke. I know Mr. Evringham will be
      pleased. She just shines from her pretty little ears to her hoofs. Take
      her around and then come back. I want to talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I don't come back,&rdquo; returned the boy, &ldquo;you'll know the governor's
      looked at me a little too hard and I've been struck so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be any foolisher than you can help,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes, &ldquo;and
      hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On 'Zekiel's return to the barn he saw that his mother's face was
      portentous. &ldquo;Lawrence was at least handsome like his father,&rdquo; she began
      without preamble, looking over Zeke's shoulder, &ldquo;but Harry was as homely
      as he was no account. I should think that man had enough of his sons'
      belongings hanging on him already. What do you think, 'Zekiel Forbes? Mr.
      Evringham's youngest son Harry has turned up again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was the old Harry by your tone,&rdquo; rejoined Zeke equably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He and his wife, poor as church mice, are getting their expenses paid to
      Europe on business, and they have the nerve&mdash;yes, the cheek&mdash;to
      ask Mr. Evringham to let them leave their young one, a girl eight years
      old, with him while they're gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it's a real courageous youngster,&rdquo; remarked Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A child! A wild Western dressmaker's young one in Mr. Evringham's elegant
      house!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the old Harry a dressmaker?&rdquo; asked Zeke mildly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, his wife is. His Julia! They've named this girl for her, and I
      suppose they called her Jule, and then twisted it around to Jewel. Jewel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is she coming?&rdquo; asked Zeke, seeing that he was expected to say
      something.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Coming? She isn't coming,&rdquo; cried his mother irefully. &ldquo;Not while Mr.
      Evringham has his wits. They haven't a particle of right to ask him. Harry
      has worried him to distraction already. The child would be sure to torment
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd devour her the second day, then,&rdquo; returned Zeke calmly. &ldquo;It would be
      soon over.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MOTHER AND DAUGHTER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard had gone, and his hostesses were awaiting the summons to
      dinner. Mrs. Evringham regarded her daughter critically as the girl sat at
      the piano, idly running her fingers over the keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The listlessness expressed in the fresh face and rounded figure brought a
      look of disapproval into the mother's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must practice that nocturne,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You played it badly just
      now, and there is no excuse for it, Eloise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will let me give lessons I will,&rdquo; responded the girl promptly,
      without turning her graceful, drooping head.
    </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected reply was startling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm so tired of it all,&rdquo; replied the girl wearily.
    </p>
    <p>
      A frown contracted her mother's forehead. &ldquo;Tired of what? Turn around
      here!&rdquo; She rose and put her hands on the pretty shoulders and turned her
      child until the clear gray eyes met hers. &ldquo;Now then, tired of what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise smiled slightly, and sighed. &ldquo;Of playing nocturnes to Dr. Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he is quite as tired of hearing you, I dare say,&rdquo; was the retort. &ldquo;It
      seems to me you always stumble when you play to the doctor, and he adores
      Chopin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise continued to meet her mother's annoyed gaze, her hands fallen in
      her lap, all the lines of her nut-brown hair, her exquisite face, and
      pliable, graceful figure so many silent arguments, as they always were,
      against any one's harboring annoyance toward her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say he does, mother, and you have assured him of it so often that the
      poor man doesn't dare to say otherwise; but really, if you'd let him have
      the latest Weber and Field hit, I think he would be so grateful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Learn it then!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise laughed lazily. &ldquo;Intrepid little mother!&rdquo; Then she added, in a
      different tone, &ldquo;Don't you think there is any danger of our being too
      obliging? I'm not the only girl in town whose mother wishes her to oblige
      Dr. Ballard. May we not overreach ourselves?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloise!&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham's half-affectionate, half-remonstrating grasp
      fell from her child's shoulders. &ldquo;That remark is in very bad taste.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head slowly. &ldquo;I never can understand why it is any
      satisfaction to you to pretend. You find comfort in pretending that Mr.
      Evringham likes to have us here, likes us to use his carriages, to receive
      his friends, and all the rest of it. We've been here seven weeks and three
      days, and that little game of pretending is satisfying you still. You are
      like the ostrich with its head in the sand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham drew her lithe figure up. &ldquo;Well, Eloise, I hope there are
      limits to this. To call your own mother an&mdash;an ostrich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't speak so loud,&rdquo; returned the girl, rising and patting her mother's
      hand. &ldquo;Grandfather has returned from his ride. I just heard him come in.
      It is too near dinner time for a scene. There is no need of our pretending
      to each other, is there? You have always put me off and put me off, but
      surely you mean to bring this to an end pretty soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could bring it to an end at once if you would!&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Evringham, her voice lowered. &ldquo;Dr. Ballard has nothing to wait for. I know
      all about his circumstances. There never was such a providence as father's
      having a friend like him ready to our hand&mdash;so suitable, so
      attractive, so rich!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; responded the girl low and equably, &ldquo;it is just five weeks and two
      days that you have been throwing me at that man's head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have done nothing of the kind, Eloise Evringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes you have,&rdquo; returned the girl without excitement, &ldquo;and grandfather
      sneering at us all the time under his mustache. He knows that there are
      other girls and other mothers interested in Dr. Ballard more desirable
      than we are. Oh! how easy it is to be more desirable than we are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't one girl in five hundred so pretty as you,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Evringham stoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish my prettiness could persuade you into my way of thinking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; The glance of the older woman was keen and suspicious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We would take a cheap little apartment to-morrow,&rdquo; said the girl
      wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham gave an ejaculation of impatience. &ldquo;And do all our own work
      and live like pigs!&rdquo; she returned petulantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I may flatter myself, but I fancy I should
      keep it rather clean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't mind your hands then.&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham regarded the hands
      worthy to be imitated by a sculptor's art, and the girl raised them and
      inspected the rose-tints of their tips. &ldquo;I've read something about rubber
      gloves,&rdquo; she returned vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better read something else then. How do you suppose you would get
      on without a carriage?&rdquo; asked her mother with exasperation. &ldquo;You have
      never had so much as a taste of privation in any form. Your suggestion is
      the acme of foolishness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could do something if you would let me,&rdquo; rejoined the girl as
      calmly as before. &ldquo;I think I could teach music pretty well, and keep house
      charmingly. If I had any false pride when we came out here, the past six
      weeks have purified me of it. Will you let me try, mother? I'm asking it
      very seriously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not!&rdquo; hotly. &ldquo;There are armies of music teachers now, and you
      would not have a chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could dress hair well,&rdquo; remarked Eloise, glancing at the
      reflection in a mirror of her own graceful coiffure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say!&rdquo; responded Mrs. Evringham with sarcastic heat, &ldquo;or I'm sure
      you could get a position as a waitress. The servant problem is growing
      worse every year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to be your waitress, mother.&rdquo; For the first time the girl lost
      her perfect poise, and the color fluctuated in her cheek. She clasped her
      hands. &ldquo;It would be heaven compared with the feeling, the sickening,
      appalling suspicion, that we are becoming akin to the adventuresses we
      read of, the pretty, luxurious women who live by their wits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence!&rdquo; commanded Mrs. Evringham, her eyes flashing and her effective
      black-clothed figure drawn up.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise sighed again. &ldquo;I didn't expect to accomplish anything by this
      talk,&rdquo; she said, relapsing into listlessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you expect then? Merely to be disagreeable? I hope you may be as
      successful in worthier undertakings. Now listen. Some of the plans you
      have suggested at various times might be sensible if you were a plain
      girl. Your beauty is as tangible an asset as money would be; but beauty
      requires money. You must have it. Your poor father might have left it to
      you, but he didn't; so you will marry it&mdash;not unsuitably,&rdquo; meeting an
      ominous look in her child's eyes, &ldquo;not without love or under any
      circumstances to make a martyr of you, but according to common sense; and
      as a certain young man is evidently more and more certain of himself every
      time he comes&rdquo;&mdash;she paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think there is no need for him to grow more certain of me?&rdquo; asked
      Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You might have saved us the disagreeables of this interview. And one
      thing more,&rdquo; impressively, &ldquo;you evidently are not taking into
      consideration, perhaps you never knew, that it was your grandfather's
      confidence in a certain course which induced your poor father to take that
      last fatal flyer. Your grandfather feels&mdash;I'm sure he feels&mdash;that
      much reparation is due us. The present conditions are easier for him than
      a separate suitable home would be, therefore&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Evringham waved
      her hand. &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;that so young a girl should not
      repose more trust in her mother's judgment. And now that we are on the
      subject, I wish you would make more effort with your grandfather. Don't be
      so silent at table and leave all the talking to me. A man of his age likes
      to have merry young people about. Chat, create a cheerful atmosphere. He
      likes to look at you, of course, but you have been so quiet and
      lackadaisical of late, it is enough to hurt his feelings as host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has never shown any symptoms of anxiety,&rdquo; remarked Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he is a very self-contained man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is indeed, poor grandfather; I don't know how you will manage, mother,
      when you have to play the game of 'pretend' all alone. He is growing tired
      of it, I can see. His courtesy is wearing very thin. I'm sorry to make it
      harder for you by taking away what must have been a large prop and
      support, but I heard papa say to himself more than once in those last sad
      days, 'If I had only taken my father's advice.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloise,&rdquo; very earnestly, &ldquo;you misunderstood, you certainly
      misunderstood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shook her head wearily. &ldquo;No, alas! I neither misunderstand nor
      forget, when it would be most convenient to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham's fair brow contracted as she regarded her daughter with
      exasperation. &ldquo;And you are only nineteen! One would think it was you
      instead of me to whom the next birthday would bring that detested forty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked at her mother, whose youthful face and figure betrayed the
      source of her own heritage of physical charm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I long ago gave up the hope of ever again being as young as you are,&rdquo; she
      returned sadly. &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; with a rare and piteous burst of feeling, &ldquo;if dear
      papa could have stayed with us, and we could have had a right somewhere!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham threw her arms about the young creature, welcoming the
      softened mood. &ldquo;You know I took you right to my own people, Eloise,&rdquo; she
      said gently. &ldquo;We stayed as long as I thought was right; they couldn't
      afford to keep us.&rdquo; A sound at the door caused her to turn. The erect form
      of her father-in-law had just entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, good evening, father,&rdquo; she said in tones whose sadness was not
      altogether feigned, even though she secretly rejoiced that Eloise should
      for once show such opportune emotion. &ldquo;Pardon this little girl. She was
      just feeling overwhelmed with a pang of homesickness for her father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;Will you walk out? Mrs. Forbes tells me
      that dinner is served.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise, hastily drawing her handkerchief across her eyes, passed the
      unbending figure, her cheeks stinging. His hard voice was in her ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      That she was not his son's child hurt her now as often before in the past
      two months, but that he should have discovered her weeping at a moment
      when he might have been expected to enter was a keen hurt to her pride,
      and her heart swelled with a suspicion of his unspoken thoughts. She had
      never been effusive, she had never posed. He had no right to suspect her.
    </p>
    <p>
      With her small head carried high and her cheeks glowing, she passed him,
      following her mother, who floated on before with much satisfaction. These
      opportune tears shed by her nonconforming child should make their stay
      good for another two months at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have had a beautiful ride, father,&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham as they
      seated themselves at table. She spoke in the tone, at once assured and
      ingratiating, which she always adopted toward him. &ldquo;I noticed you took an
      earlier start than usual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker had never had the insight to discover that her father-in-law
      was ungrateful for proofs that any of his long-fixed, solitary habits were
      now observed by feminine eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did take a rather longer ride than usual,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes, I
      wish you would speak to the cook about the soup. It has been served cool
      for the last two days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes flushed as she stood near his chair in her trim black gown and
      white apron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; she replied, the flush and quiet words giving little
      indication of the tumult aroused within her by her employer's criticism.
      To fail to please Mr. Evringham at his meals was the deepest mortification
      life held for her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure it tastes very good,&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham amiably, &ldquo;although I
      like a little more salt than your cook uses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can reach it I hope,&rdquo; remarked the host, casting a glance at the
      dainty solitaire salt and pepper beside his daughter's plate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don't you like it cooked in?&rdquo; she asked sweetly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not when I want to get it out,&rdquo; he answered shortly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How can mother, how can mother!&rdquo; thought Eloise helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is decided spring in the air to-day,&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;I
      remember of old how charmingly spring comes in the park.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have a good memory,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say that?&rdquo; asked the pretty widow, lifting large, innocent
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is some years since you accompanied Lawrence in his calls upon me, I
      believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor father!&rdquo; thought Mrs. Evringham, &ldquo;how unpleasantly blunt he has
      grown, living here alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I scarcely realize it,&rdquo; she returned suavely. &ldquo;My recollection of the
      park is always so clear. It is surprising, isn't it, how relatives can
      live as near together as we in New York and you out here and see one
      another so seldom! Life in New York,&rdquo; sighing, &ldquo;was such a rush for us.
      Here amid the rustle of the trees it seems to be scarcely the same world.
      Lawrence often said his only lucid intervals were during the rides he took
      with Eloise in Central Park. Do you always ride alone, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Always,&rdquo; was the prompt rejoinder, while Eloise cast a glance full of
      appeal at her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      The latter continued archly, &ldquo;If you could see Eloise on a horse you would
      not blame me for trying to screw up my courage, as I have been doing for
      days past, to ask you if she might take a canter on Essex Maid in the
      morning, sometimes, while you are away. Fanshaw assured me that she would
      be perfectly safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham's cold eyes stared, and then the enormity of the proposition
      appeared to move him humorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which maid did Fanshaw say would be safe?&rdquo; he inquired, while Eloise
      glowed with mortification.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you think Eloise can't ride, try her some time!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      widow gayly. It had been a matter of surprise and afterward of resentment
      that Mr. Evringham could remain deaf to her hints so long, and she had
      determined to become frank. &ldquo;Or else ask Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; she went on; &ldquo;he
      has very kindly provided Eloise with a horse several times, but the child
      likes a solitary ride, sometimes, as well as you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The steely look returned to the host's eyes. &ldquo;No one rides the Maid but
      myself,&rdquo; he returned coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg you to believe, grandfather, that I don't wish to ride her,&rdquo; said
      Eloise, her customary languor of manner gone and her voice hard. &ldquo;Mother
      is more ambitious for me than I am for myself. I should be very much
      obliged if she would allow me to ask favors when I want them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes's lips were set in a tight line as she filled Mrs. Evringham's
      glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      That lady's heart was beating a little fast from vexation, and also from
      the knowledge that a time of reckoning with her child was coming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well,&rdquo; she said airily. &ldquo;No wonder you are careful of that
      beautiful creature. I caught Eloise with her arms around the mare's neck
      the other day, and I couldn't help wishing for a kodak. You feed her with
      sugar, don't you Eloise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, I'm sure!&rdquo; exclaimed Mr. Evringham sternly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not do it again, grandfather,&rdquo; said the girl, her very ears burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham sighed and gave one Parthian shot. &ldquo;The poor child does
      love horses so,&rdquo; she murmured softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The host scowled and fidgeted in his chair with a brusque gesture to Mrs.
      Forbes to remove the course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry has turned up again,&rdquo; he remarked, to change the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo; returned his daughter-in-law languidly. &ldquo;For how long I wonder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks it is permanent.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is still in Chicago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for a day or two. He and his wife sail for Europe immediately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; with a greater show of interest. Then, curiously, &ldquo;Are you
      sending them, father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scarcely! They are going on business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; relapsing into indifference. &ldquo;They have a child, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a girl. I should think perhaps you might have remembered it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hardly see why, if Harry didn't&mdash;a fact he plainly showed by
      deserting the poor creature.&rdquo; The insolence of the speaker's tone was
      scarcely veiled. Her extreme disapproval of her father-in-law sometimes
      welled to the surface of her suave manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham's thoughts had fled to Chicago. &ldquo;Harry proposed leaving the
      girl here while they are gone,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham straightened in her chair and her attention concentrated.
      &ldquo;With you? What assurance! How like Harry!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The words were precisely those which her host had been saying to himself;
      but proceeding from her lips they had a strange effect upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You find it so?&rdquo; he asked. The clearer the proposition became to Mrs.
      Evringham's consciousness the more she resented it. To have the child in
      the house not only would menace her ease and comfort, but meant a
      possibility that the grandfather might take an interest in Harry's
      daughter which would disturb Eloise's chances.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it does. I call it simply presumptuous,&rdquo; she declared with
      emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After all, Harry has some rights,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Evringham slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His wife is a dressmaker,&rdquo; went on the other. &ldquo;I had it directly from a
      Chicago friend. Harry has scarcely been with the child since she was born.
      And to saddle a little stranger like that on you! Now Eloise and <i>her</i>
      father were inseparable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an ominous glitter in Mr. Evringham's eyes. &ldquo;Eloise's father!&rdquo;
       he returned slowly. &ldquo;I did not know that she remembered him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The hurt of his tone and words sank deep into the heart of the girl, but
      she looked up courageously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your son was my father in every best sense,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We were
      inseparable. You must have known it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You appeared to be separable when your father made his visits to Bel-Air
      Park,&rdquo; was the rejoinder. &ldquo;Pardon me if I knew very little of what took
      place in his household. A telegraph blank, please, Mrs. Forbes, and tell
      Zeke to be ready to go to the office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a vital tone in the usually dry voice. Mrs. Evringham looked
      apprehensively at her daughter; but Eloise gave her no answering glance;
      her eyes were downcast and her pretense of eating continued, while her

      CHAPTER IV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      FATHER AND SON
    </h3>
    <p>
      When later they were alone, the girl looked at her mother, her eyes
      luminous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see,&rdquo; she began rather breathlessly, &ldquo;even you must see, he is
      beginning to drive us away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do hope, Eloise, you are not going to indulge in any heroics over this
      affair,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham, who had braced herself to meet an
      attack. &ldquo;Does the unpleasant creature suppose we would stay with him if we
      were not obliged to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If we are obliged to, which I don't admit, need you demand further favors
      than food and shelter? How could you speak of Essex Maid! How can you know
      in your inmost heart, as you do, that we are eating the bread of charity,
      and then ask for the apple of his eye!&rdquo; exclaimed Eloise desperately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away with your bread and apples,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Evringham flippantly.
      &ldquo;I have a real worry now that that wretched little cousin of yours is
      coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is not my cousin please remember,&rdquo; responded the girl bitterly. &ldquo;Mr.
      Evringham reminded us of that to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you begin calling him Mr. Evringham!&rdquo; protested her mother.
      &ldquo;You don't want to take any notice of the man's absurdities. You will only
      make matters worse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I shall go on saying grandfather for the little while we stay.
      Otherwise, he would know his words were rankling. It <i>will</i> be a
      little while? Oh mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham pushed the pleading hand away. &ldquo;I can't tell how long it
      will be!&rdquo; she returned impatiently. &ldquo;We are simply helpless until your
      father's affairs are settled. I thought I had told you that, Eloise. He
      worshipped you, child, and no matter what that old curmudgeon says,
      Lawrence would wish us to remain under his protection until we see our way
      clear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Won't you have a business talk with him, so we can know what we have to
      look forward to?&rdquo; The girl's voice was unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will when the right time comes, Eloise. Can't you trust your mother?
      Isn't it enough that we have lost our home, our carriages, all our
      comforts and luxuries, through this man's bad judgment&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will cling to that!&rdquo; despairingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And have had to come out to this Sleepy Hollow of a place, where life
      means mere existence, and be so poor that the carfare into New York is
      actually a consideration! I'm quite satisfied with our martyrdom as it is,
      without pinching and grinding as we should have to do to live elsewhere.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you don't mean to attempt to escape?&rdquo; returned Eloise in alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush, Goosie. We will escape all in good time if we don't succeed
      in taming the bear. As it is, I have to work single handed,&rdquo; dropping into
      a tone of reproach. &ldquo;You are no help at all. You might as well be a
      simpering wax dummy out of a shop window. I would have been ashamed at
      your age if I could not have subjugated any man alive. We might have had
      him at our feet weeks ago if you had made an effort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, mother,&rdquo; sadly. &ldquo;I saw when we first came how effusiveness
      impressed him, and I tried to behave so as to strike a balance&mdash;that
      is, after I found that we were here on sufferance and not as welcome
      guests.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pshaw! You can't tell what such a hermit is thinking,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Evringham. &ldquo;It is the best thing that could happen to him to have us here.
      Dr. Ballard said so only to-day. What is troubling me now is this child of
      Harry's. I was sure by father's tone when he first spoke of her that he
      would not even consider such an imposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think he did feel so,&rdquo; returned Eloise, her manner quiet again. &ldquo;That
      was an example of the way you overreach yourself. The word presumption on
      your lips applied to uncle Harry determined grandfather to let the child
      come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think he really has sent for her then!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham.
      &ldquo;You think that is what the telegram meant! I'm sure of it, too.&rdquo; Then
      after a minute's exasperated thought, &ldquo;I believe you are right. He is just
      contrary enough for that. If I had urged him to let the little barbarian
      come, he couldn't have been induced to do so. That wasn't clever of me!&rdquo;
       The speaker made the admission in a tone which implied that in general her
      cleverness was unquestioned. &ldquo;Well, I hope she will worry him out of his
      senses, and I don't think there is much doubt of it. It may turn out all
      for the best, Eloise, after all, and lead him to appreciate us.&rdquo; Mrs.
      Evringham cast a glance at the mirror and patted her waved hair. &ldquo;And yet
      I'm anxious, very anxious. He might take a fancy to the girl,&rdquo; she added
      thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm such a poor-spirited creature,&rdquo; remarked Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to be strong enough to leave you since you will not come; to
      leave this roof and earn my own living, some way, any way; but I'm too
      much of a coward.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so,&rdquo; returned her mother briefly. &ldquo;You'd soon become one if
      you weren't at starting. Girls bred to luxury, as you have been, must just
      contrive to live well somehow. They can't stand anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, mother,&rdquo; quietly. &ldquo;They can. They do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, in books I know they do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, truth is stranger than fiction. They do. I have been looking for that
      sort of stamina in myself for weeks, but I haven't found it. It is a cruel
      wrong to a girl not to teach her to support herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear! You were going to college. You know you would have gone had it
      not been for your poor father's misfortunes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's eyes filled again at the remembrance of the young, gay man who
      had been her boon companion since her babyhood, and at the memory of those
      last sad days, when she knew he had agonized over her future even more
      than over that of his volatile wife.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear, as I've told you before, a girl as pretty as you are should know
      that fortune cannot be unkind, nor the sea of life too rough. In each of
      the near waves of it you can see a man's head swimming toward you. You
      don't know the trouble I have had already in silencing those who wished to
      speak before you were old enough. They could any of them be summoned now
      with a word. Let me see. There is Mr. Derwent&mdash;Mr. Follansbee&mdash;Mr.
      Weeks&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, mother!&rdquo; ejaculated the girl in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Exactly. I knew you would say they were too old, or too bald, or too
      short, or too fat. I've been a girl myself. Of course there is Nat
      Bonnell, and a lot more little waves and ripples like him, but they always
      <i>were</i> out of the question, and now they are ten times more so. That
      is the reason, Eloise,&rdquo; the mother's voice became impressive to the verge
      of solemnity, &ldquo;why I feel that Dr. Ballard is almost a providence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's clear eyes were reflective. &ldquo;Nat Bonnell is a wave who wouldn't
      remember a girl who had slipped out of the swim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very wise of him,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham emphatically. &ldquo;He can't afford
      to. Nat is&mdash;is&mdash;a&mdash;decorative creature, just as you are,&mdash;decorative.
      He must make it pay, poor boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Mrs. Forbes had sought her son in the barn. He and she had had
      their supper in time for her to be ready to wait at dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something doing, something doing,&rdquo; murmured Zeke as he heard the
      impetuosity of her approaching step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That soup <i>was</i> hot!&rdquo; she exclaimed defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somebody scald you, ma? I can do him up, whoever he is,&rdquo; said Zeke,
      catching up a whip and executing a threatening dance around the dimly
      lighted barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mother's snapping eyes looked beyond him. &ldquo;He said it was cold; but it
      was only because he was distracted. What do you suppose those people are
      up to now? Trying to get Essex Maid for Mamzell to ride!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke stopped in his mad career and returned his mother's stare for a
      silent moment. &ldquo;And not a dungeon on the place probably!&rdquo; he exclaimed at
      last. &ldquo;Just like some folks' shiftlessness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They <i>asked</i> it. They asked Mr. Evringham if that girl couldn't ride
      Essex Maid while he was in the city!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Zekiel lifted his eyebrows politely. &ldquo;Where are their remains to be
      interred?&rdquo; he inquired with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not in <i>this</i> family vault, you may be sure. He gave it to
      them to-night for a fact.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes smiled triumphantly. &ldquo;'I didn't
      know Eloise remembered her father,'&rdquo; she mimicked. &ldquo;I'll bet that got
      under their skin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear parent, you're excited,&rdquo; remarked Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought her reminiscent gaze back to rest upon her son. &ldquo;Get your coat
      quick, 'Zekiel. Here's the telegram. Take the car that passes the park
      gate, and stop at the station. That's the nearest place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Ezekiel obediently struggled into the coat hanging conveniently near.
      &ldquo;What does the telegram say?&mdash;'Run away, little girl, the ogre isn't
      hungry'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much! She's coming. He's sending for the brat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor brat! How did it happen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just some more of my lady's doings,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Forbes angrily. &ldquo;Of
      course she had to put in her oar and exasperate Mr. Evringham until he did
      it to spite her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cutting off his own nose to spite his face, eh?&rdquo; asked Zeke, taking the
      slip of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and mine. It's going to come heavy on me. I could have shaken that
      woman with her airs and graces. Catch her or Mamzell lifting <i>their</i>
      hands!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yet they want her, do they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Stupid! That's why she's coming. Can't you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Blessed if I can,&rdquo; returned the boy as he left the barn; &ldquo;but I know one
      thing, I pity the kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham received a prompt answer to his message. His son appointed,
      as a place of meeting, the downtown hotel where he and his wife purposed
      spending the night before sailing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Father and son had not met for years, and Mr. Evringham debated a few
      minutes whether to take the gastronomic and social risk of dining with
      Harry <i>en famille</i> at the noisy hotel above mentioned, or to have
      dinner in assured comfort at his club&mdash;finally deciding on the latter
      course.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was, therefore, nearly nine o'clock before his card was presented to
      Mr. and Mrs. Harry, to whom it brought considerable relief of mind, and
      they hastened down to the dingy parlor with alacrity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see we thought you might accept our invitation to dinner,&rdquo; said Harry
      heartily, as he grasped his parent's passive hand; &ldquo;but your business
      hours are so short, I dare say you have been at home since the middle of
      the afternoon.&rdquo; As he spoke the hard lines of his father's impassive face
      smote him with a thousand associations, many of them bringing remorse. He
      wondered how much his own conduct had had to do with graving them so
      deeply.
    </p>
    <p>
      His wife's observant eyes were scanning this guardian of her child from
      the crown of his immaculate head to the toes of his correct patent
      leathers. His expressionless eyes turned to her. &ldquo;This is your wife?&rdquo; he
      asked, again offering the passive hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father, this is Julia,&rdquo; responded Harry proudly. &ldquo;I'm sorry the time
      is so short. I do want you to know her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man's face grew eloquent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is a pleasure to come,&rdquo; responded Mr. Evringham mechanically. He
      turned stiffly and cast a glance about. &ldquo;You brought your daughter, I
      presume?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;Harry was so glad to receive your
      permission. We had made arrangements for her provisionally with friends in
      Chicago, but we were desirous that she should have this opportunity to see
      her father's home and know you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham thought with regret of those friends in Chicago. Many times
      in the last two days he had deeply repented allowing himself to be
      exasperated into thus committing himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do sit down, father,&rdquo; said Harry, as his wife seated herself in the
      nearest chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham hesitated before complying. &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said perfunctorily,
      &ldquo;you have gone into something that promises well, eh Harry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks that way. I'm chiefly occupied these days in being thankful.&rdquo;
       The young man smiled with an extraordinary sweetness of expression, which
      transfigured his face, and which his father remembered well as always
      promising much and performing nothing. &ldquo;I might spend a lot of time crying
      over spilt milk, but Julia says I mustn't,&rdquo;&mdash;he glanced across at his
      wife, whose dark eyes smiled back,&mdash;&ldquo;and what Julia says goes. I
      intend to spend a year or two doing instead of talking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will answer better,&rdquo; remarked his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; Harry's voice grew still more earnest. &ldquo;And by that time,
      perhaps, I can express my regret to you, for things done and things left
      undone, with more convincingness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older man made a slight gesture of rejection with one well-kept hand.
      &ldquo;Let bygones be bygones,&rdquo; he returned briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When I think,&rdquo; pursued Harry, his impulsive manner in strange contrast to
      that of his listener, &ldquo;that if I had been behaving myself all this time, I
      might have seen dear old Lawrence again!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham kept silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are Madge and Eloise? I thought perhaps Madge might come in and meet
      us at the train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are in the best of health, thank you. Eh&mdash;a&mdash;I think if
      you'll call your daughter now we will go. It's rather a long ride, you
      know. No express trains at this hour. When you return we will have more of
      a visit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry and his wife exchanged a glance. &ldquo;Why Jewel is asleep,&rdquo; answered the
      young man after a pause. &ldquo;She was so sleepy she couldn't hold her eyes
      open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you've let her go to bed?&rdquo; asked Mr. Evringham, with a not very
      successful attempt to veil his surprise and annoyance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;yes. We supposed she would see us off, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your memory is rather short, it strikes me,&rdquo; returned his father. &ldquo;You
      sail at eight A.M., I believe. Did you think I could get in from Bel-Air
      at that hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I thought you would naturally remain in the city over night. You used
      to stay in rather frequently, didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've not done so for five years; but you couldn't know that. Is it out of
      the question to dress the child again? I hope she is too healthy to be
      disturbed by a trifle like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham cast a startled look at her father-in-law. &ldquo;It would
      disappoint Jewel very much not to see us off,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;Let it go then. Let it go,&rdquo; he said
      quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry's plain face had grown concerned. &ldquo;Is Mrs. Forbes with you still?&rdquo;
       he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes. I couldn't keep house without Mrs. Forbes. Well,&rdquo; rising, &ldquo;if
      you young people will excuse me, I believe I will go to the club and turn
      in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you stand it here one night, do you think?&rdquo; asked Harry, rising.
      &ldquo;The club is rather far uptown for such an early start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I'll be on hand. I'm used to rising early for a canter. I'll take it
      with a cab horse this time. That will be all the difference.&rdquo; And with
      this attempt at jocularity, Mr. Evringham shook hands once more and
      departed, swallowing his ill-humor as best he could. Any instincts of the
      family man which might once have reigned in him had long since been
      inhibited. This episode was a cruel invasion upon his bachelor habits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Left alone, Harry and his wife without a word ascended to their room and
      with one accord approached the little bed in the corner where their child
      lay asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      The man took his wife's hand. &ldquo;I've done it now, Julia,&rdquo; he said
      dejectedly. &ldquo;It's my confounded optimism again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your optimism is all right,&rdquo; she returned, smoothing his hand gently,
      though her heart was beating fast, and the vision of her father-in-law,
      with his elegant figure and cold eyes, was weighing upon her spirit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry looked long on the plain little sleeping face, so like his own in
      spite of its exquisite child-coloring, and bending, touched the tossed,
      straight, flaxen hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We couldn't take her, I suppose?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; replied the yearning mother quietly. &ldquo;We have prayed over it. We
      must know that all will be right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His bark is worse than his bite,&rdquo; said Harry doubtfully. &ldquo;It always was;
      and Mrs. Forbes is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say she is a kind sort of woman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I suppose so,&rdquo; uncertainly. &ldquo;I never had much to do with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And your sister? Isn't it very strange that she didn't come in to meet
      us? I was so certain I should put Jewel into her hands I feel a little
      bewildered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're a trump!&rdquo; ejaculated Harry hotly, &ldquo;and you've married into a
      family where they're scarce. Madge might have met us at the train, at
      least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps she is very sad over her loss,&rdquo; suggested Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the best of health. Father said so. Oh well, she never was anything
      but a big butterfly and Eloise a little one. I remember the last time I
      saw the child, a pretty fairy with her long pink silk stockings. She must
      have been just about the age of Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mother stooped over the little bed and the dingy room looked
      pleasanter for her smile. &ldquo;Jewel hasn't any pink silk stockings,&rdquo; she
      murmured, and kissed the warm rose of the round cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl stirred and opened her eyes, at first vaguely, then with a
      start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it time for the boat?&rdquo; she asked, trying to rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father smoothed her hair. &ldquo;No, time to go to sleep again. We're just
      going to bed. Good-night, Jewel.&rdquo; He stooped to kiss her, and her arms met
      around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was an April fool, wasn't it?&rdquo; she murmured sleepily, and was
      unconscious again.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mother hid her face for a moment on her husband's shoulder. &ldquo;Help me
      to feel that we're doing right,&rdquo; she whispered, with a catch in her
      breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if I could help <i>you</i>, Julia!&rdquo; he returned humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you can, dear.&rdquo; She withdrew from his embrace, and going to the
      dresser, took down her hair. The smiling face of a doll looked up at her
      from the neighboring chair, where it was sitting bolt upright. Her costume
      was fresh from the modiste, and her feet, though hopelessly pigeon-toed,
      were encased in bronze boots of a freshness which caught the dim gaslight
      with a golden sheen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham smiled through her moist eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jewel <i>was</i> sleepy. She forgot to undress Anna Belle,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Letting her hair fall about her like a veil, she caught up the doll and
      pressed it to her heart impulsively. &ldquo;You are going to stay with her, Anna
      Belle! I envy you, I envy you!&rdquo; she whispered. An irrepressible tear fell
      on the sumptuous trimming of the little hat. &ldquo;Be good to her; comfort her,
      comfort her, little dolly.&rdquo; Hastily wiping her eyes, she turned to her
      husband, still holding the doll. &ldquo;We shall have to be very careful, Harry,
      in the morning. If we are harboring one wrong or fearful thought, we must
      not let Jewel know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish it were over! I wish the next month were over!&rdquo; he replied
      restively.

      CHAPTER V
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BON VOYAGE
    </h3>
    <p>
      At the dock next morning the scene was one of the usual confusion. The
      sailing time was drawing near and Mr. Evringham had not appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Harry, with his little girl's hand in his, stood at the foot of the gang
      plank, peering at every newcomer and growing more anxious every moment.
      Jewel occupied herself in throwing kisses to her mother, who stood at the
      rail far above, never taking her eyes from the little figure in the blue
      sailor suit.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child noted her father's set lips and the concentrated expression of
      his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If grandpa doesn't come what shall I do?&rdquo; she asked without anxiety.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll go to England,&rdquo; was the prompt response.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without my trunk!&rdquo; returned the child in protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her father looked again at the watch he held in his hand. The order to go
      ashore was sending all visitors down the gang plank. &ldquo;By George, I guess
      you're going, too,&rdquo; he muttered between his teeth, when suddenly his
      father's tall form came striding through the crowd. Mr. Evringham was
      carrying a long pasteboard box, and seemed breathless.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Horse fell down. Devil of a time! Roses for your wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Harry grasped the box, touched his father's hand, kissed the child, and
      strode up the plank amid the frowns of officials.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eager eyes followed him, then, as he disappeared, lifted again to
      her mother, who smiled and waved her hand to Mr. Evringham. The latter
      raised his hat and took the occasion to wipe his heated brow. He was
      irritated through and through. The morning had been a chapter of
      accidents. Even the roses, which he had ordered the night before, had
      proved to be the wrong sort.
    </p>
    <p>
      The suspense of the last fifteen minutes had been a distressing wrong to
      put upon any man. He had now before him the prospect of caring for a
      strange child, of taking her out of town at an hour when he should have
      been coming into it. She would probably cry. Very well; if she did he
      determined on the instant to ride out to Bel-Air in the smoking car,
      although he detested its odors and uncleanness. The whole situation was
      enormous. What a fool he had been, and what an intelligent woman was Mrs.
      Forbes! She had seen from the first the inappropriateness, the
      impossibility, of the whole proposition. His attention was attracted to
      the fact that the small figure at his side was hopping up and down with
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's father, there's father!&rdquo; she cried, as Harry joined his wife at
      the rail and they lifted the wealth of roses from the box and waved them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've wronged him, Harry!&rdquo; exclaimed Julia, trying to see the little face
      below through her misty eyes. &ldquo;How I love him for bringing me these sweet
      things! It gives me such a different feeling about him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, father would as soon forget his breakfast as roses for a woman he was
      seeing off,&rdquo; returned Harry without enthusiasm, while he waved his hat
      energetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      The steamer pulled out. The faces in the crowd mingled and changed places.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've lost them, I've lost them!&rdquo; cried Julia. &ldquo;Oh, where are they,
      Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over there near the corner. I can see father. It's all right, dear,&rdquo;
       choking a little. &ldquo;Jewel was skipping and laughing a minute ago. It will
      only be a few weeks, but confound it,&rdquo; violently, &ldquo;next time we'll take
      her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Julia buried her face in the roses, on which twinkled a sudden dew, and
      tried to gather promise from their sweet breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel strained her eyes to follow the now indistinguishable forms on the
      lofty deck, and her grandfather looked down at the small figure in the
      sailor suit, the short thick pigtails of flaxen hair tied with large bows
      of ribbon, and the doll clasped in one arm. At last the child turned her
      head and looked up, and their eyes met for the first time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove, she does look like Harry!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Evringham, and even as he
      spoke the plain little face was illumined with the smile he knew, that
      surpassingly sweet smile which promised so much and performed nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child studied him with open, innocent curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't believe it's you,&rdquo; she said at last, in a voice light and
      winning, a voice as sweet as the smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't wonder. I don't quite know myself this morning,&rdquo; he replied
      brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have a picture of you, but it's a long-ago one, and I thought by this
      time you would be old, and&mdash;and bent over, you know, the way grandpas
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even in that place of drays and at eight o'clock A.M. these words fell not
      disagreeably upon irritated ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think myself Nature did not intend me to be a grandpa,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, you're just the right kind,&rdquo; returned the child hastily and
      confidently. &ldquo;Strong and&mdash;and handsome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham looked at her in amazement. &ldquo;The little rascal!&rdquo; he thought.
      &ldquo;Has she been coached?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose we may get away from here now,&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;There's nothing
      more to wait for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't the roses make mother happy?&rdquo; asked the little girl, trotting
      along beside his long strides. &ldquo;I think it was wonderful for you to bring
      them so early in the morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham summoned a cab.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are we gong in a carriage?&rdquo; cried Jewel, highly pleased. &ldquo;But I
      mustn't forget, grandpa, there's something father told me I must give you
      the first thing. Will you take Anna Belle a minute, please?&rdquo; and Mr.
      Evringham found himself holding the doll fiercely by one leg while small
      hands worked at the catch of a very new little leather side-bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Jewel produced a brass square.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, your trunk check.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham exchanged the doll for it with
      alacrity. &ldquo;Get in.&rdquo; He held open the cab door.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel obeyed, but not without some misgivings when her guardian so coolly
      pocketed the check.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's for my trunk,&rdquo; she replied when her grandfather was beside her
      and they began rattling over the stones. &ldquo;I have a checked silk dress,&rdquo;
       she added softly, after a pause. It were well to let him know the value of
      her baggage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you indeed? How old are you, Julia? Your name is Julia, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, my <i>name's</i> Julia, but so is mother's, and they call me
      Jewel. I'm nearly nine, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. Time flies,&rdquo; was the brief response.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked out of the cab window in the noisy silence that followed. At
      last her voice was raised to sound through the clatter. &ldquo;I suppose my
      trunk is somewhere else,&rdquo; she said suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your trunk will reach home all right, plaid silk and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel smiled, and lifting the doll she let her look out the window upon
      the uninviting prospect. &ldquo;Anna Belle's clothes are in the trunk, too,&rdquo; she
      added, turning and speaking confidentially.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whose?&rdquo; asked Mr. Evringham, startled. &ldquo;There's no one else coming, I
      suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this is Anna Belle,&rdquo; returned the child, laughing and lifting the
      bisque beauty so that the full radiance of her smile beamed upon her
      companion. &ldquo;That's your great-grandfather, dearie, that I've told you
      about,&rdquo; she said patronizingly. &ldquo;We've been so <i>excited</i> the last few
      days since we knew we were coming,&rdquo; looking again at Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;I've
      told Anna Belle all about beautiful Bel-Air Park, and the big house, and
      the big trees, and the ravine, and the brook. Isn't it nice,&rdquo; joyfully,
      &ldquo;that it doesn't rain to-day, and we shall see it in the sunshine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rain would have made it more disagreeable certainly,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Evringham, congratulating himself that he was escaping that further rain
      of tears which he had dreaded. &ldquo;It is a good day for your father and
      mother to set out on their trip,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and they're only to be gone six little weeks,&rdquo; returned Jewel,
      smoothing her doll's boa; &ldquo;and I'm to have this lovely visit, and I'm to
      write them very often, and they'll write to me, and we shall all be so
      happy!&rdquo; Jewel trotted Anna Belle on her short-skirted knee and hummed a
      tune, which was lost in the rattle of wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can read and write, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh ye&mdash;es!&rdquo; replied the child with amused scorn. &ldquo;How would I get my
      lessons if I couldn't read? Of course&mdash;big words,&rdquo; she added
      conscientiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; agreed Mr. Evringham dryly. &ldquo;Big words, I dare say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden thought occurring to his companion, she looked up again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You pretty nearly didn't come,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and just think, if you hadn't
      I was going to England. Father said so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the sweet inflections of the child's voice Mr. Evringham's brows
      contracted with remembrance of his wrongs. &ldquo;I should have come. Your
      father might have known that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he wouldn't have liked to leave me sitting on the dock alone,
      but I should have known you'd come. The funny part is I shouldn't have
      known <i>you</i>.&rdquo; Jewel laughed. &ldquo;I should have kept looking for an old
      man with white hair and a cane like Grandpa Morris. He's a grandpa in
      Chicago that I know. He's just as kind as he can be, but he has the <i>queerest</i>
      back. He goes to our church, but says he came in at the eleventh hour. I
      think he used to have rheumatism. And while I was sitting there you could
      have walked right by me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then you'd have known <i>me</i>,&rdquo; went on Jewel, straightening Anna
      Belle's hat, &ldquo;so it would have been all right. You'd have known there
      would be only one little girl waiting there, and you would have said, 'Oh,
      here you are, Jewel. I've come. I'm your grandpa.'&rdquo; The child
      unconsciously mimicked the short, brusque speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham regarded her rather darkly. &ldquo;Eh? I hope you're not
      impudent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked Jewel doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion's brow grew darker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Impudent I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what is impudent?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you know?&rdquo; suspiciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir,&rdquo; replied the child, some anxiety clouding her bright look. &ldquo;Is
      it error?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham regarded her rather blankly. &ldquo;It's something you mustn't
      be,&rdquo; he replied at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's face cleared. &ldquo;Oh no, I won't then,&rdquo; she replied earnestly. &ldquo;You
      tell me when I'm&mdash;it, because I want to make you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham cleared his throat. He felt somewhat embarrassed and was
      glad they had reached the ferry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're going on a boat, aren't we?&rdquo; she asked when they had passed through
      the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and we can make this boat if we hurry.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham suddenly felt
      a little hand slide into his. Jewel was skipping along beside him to keep
      up with his long strides, and he glanced down at the bobbing flaxen head
      with its large ribbon bows, while the impulse to withdraw his hand was
      thwarted by the closer clinging of the small fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father told me about the ferry,&rdquo; said Jewel with satisfaction, &ldquo;and
      you'll show me the statue of Liberty won't you, grandpa? Isn't it a
      splendid boat? Oh, can we go out close to the water?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham sighed heavily. He did not wish to go out close to the
      water. He wished to sit down in comfort in the cabin and read the paper
      which he had just taken from a newsboy. It seemed to him a very long time
      since he had done anything he wished to; but a little hand was pulling
      eagerly at his, and mechanically he followed out to where the brisk spring
      wind ruffled the river and assaulted his hat. He jerked his hand from
      Jewel's to hold it in place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't this beautiful!&rdquo; cried the child joyfully, as the boat steamed on.
      &ldquo;Can you do this every day, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Oh yes, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in the tone caused the little girl to look up from her view of
      the wide water spaces to the grim face above.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there something that makes you sorry, grandpa?&rdquo; she asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      His eyes were fixed on a ferry boat, black with its human freight, about
      to pass them on its way to the city.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wishing I were on that boat. That's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl lifted her shoulders. &ldquo;I don't believe there's room,&rdquo; she
      said, looking smilingly for a response from her companion. &ldquo;I don't
      believe even Anna Belle could squeeze on. Do you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, holding his hat with one hand, was endeavoring to fetter
      the lively corners of his newspaper in such shape that he could at least
      get a glimpse of headlines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see a statue. Is that it, grandpa? Is that it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; vaguely. &ldquo;Oh yes. The statue of Liberty. Yes, that's it. As if
      there was any liberty for anybody!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Evringham into his
      mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't so very big,&rdquo; objected Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We're not so very near it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just think,&rdquo; gayly, &ldquo;father and mother are sailing away just the way we
      are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham, trying to read the report of the stock
      market, and becoming more impatient each instant with the sportive breeze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; he said at last, &ldquo;I am going into the cabin to read the paper.
      Will you go in, or do you wish to stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I stay here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; doubtfully, &ldquo;I suppose so, if you won't climb on the rail, or&mdash;or
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel laughed in gleeful appreciation of the joke. Her grandfather met her
      blue eyes unsmilingly and vanished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish grandpa didn't look so sorry,&rdquo; she thought regretfully. &ldquo;He is a
      very important man, grandpa is, and perhaps he has a lot of error to meet
      and doesn't know how to meet it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Watching the dancing waves and constantly calling Anna Belle's attention
      to some point of interest on the water front or a passing craft, she
      nevertheless pursued a train of thought concerning her important relative,
      with the result that when the gong sounded for landing, and Mr.
      Evringham's impassive countenance reappeared, she met him with concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't it make you sorry to read the morning paper, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes. Depends on the record of the Exchange.&rdquo; There was somewhat
      less of the irritation of a newsless man in the morning in the speaker's
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother calls the paper the Daily Saddener,&rdquo; pursued Jewel, again slipping
      her hand into her grandfather's as a matter of course as they moved slowly
      off the boat. &ldquo;I've been thinking that perhaps you're in a hurry to get to
      business, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child did not quote his words about the ingoing ferry boat lest he
      should feel regret at having spoken them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's no use in my being in a hurry this morning,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to ask, couldn't you show me how to go to Bel-Air, so you
      wouldn't have to take so much time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A gleam of hope came into Mr. Evringham's cold eyes and he looked down on
      his companion doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to go out on the train,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned the child, &ldquo;but you could put me on it, and every time it
      stops I would ask somebody if that was Bel-Air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prospect this offered was very pleasing to the broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't be afraid, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be what?&rdquo; asked Jewel, looking up at him with a certain reproachful
      surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wouldn't, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, grandpa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe it would do well enough, since you don't mind. Zeke is
      going to meet this train. I'll tell the conductor to see that you get off
      at Bel-Air, and when you do, ask for Mr. Evringham's coachman. You'll see
      Zeke, a light-haired man driving a brown horse in a brougham. He'll take
      you home to his mother, Mrs. Forbes. She is my housekeeper. Now, do you
      think you'll understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It sounds very easy,&rdquo; returned Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham's long legs and her short skipping ones lost no time in
      boarding the train, which they found made up. The relieved man saw the
      conductor, paid the child's fare, and settled her on the plush seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there, contentedly swinging her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I can just catch a boat if I leave you immediately,&rdquo; said Mr.
      Evringham consulting his watch. &ldquo;You've only a little more than five
      minutes to wait before the train starts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then hurry, grandpa, I'm all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Your fare is paid, and the conductor understands. You might
      ask somebody, though. Bel-Air, you know. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hastily he strode down the aisle and left the train. Having to pass the
      window beside which Jewel sat, he glanced up with a half uneasy memory of
      how far short of the floor her feet had swung.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was watching for him. On her lips was the sweet gay smile and&mdash;yes,
      there was no mistake&mdash;Anna Belle's countenance was beaming through
      the glass, and she was wafting kisses to Mr. Evringham from a stiff and
      chubby hand. The stockbroker grew warm, cleared his throat, lifted his
      hat, and hurried his pace.

      CHAPTER VI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JEWEL'S ARRIVAL
    </h3>
    <p>
      When her grandfather had disappeared, Jewel placed Anna Belle on the seat
      beside her, where she toed in, in a state of the utmost complacence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have my work to do, Anna Belle,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and this will be a good
      time, so don't disturb me till the train starts.&rdquo; She put her hand over
      her eyes, and sat motionless as the people met and jostled in the aisle.
    </p>
    <p>
      Minutes passed, and then some one brushed the child's arm in taking the
      seat beside her. &ldquo;Oh, please don't sit on Anna Belle!&rdquo; she cried suddenly,
      and looked up into a pair of clear eyes that were regarding her with
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      They belonged to a man with a brown mustache and dark, short, pointed
      beard, who carried a small square black case and had altogether a very
      clean, fresh, agreeable appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I look like a person who would sit on Anna Belle?&rdquo; he asked gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doll was enthroned upon his knee as he set down his case, and the
      train started.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she annoys you I'll take her,&rdquo; said Jewel, with a little air of
      motherliness not lost upon her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;but I'm used to children. She looks like a fine,
      healthy little girl,&rdquo; keeping his eyes fixed on the doll's rosy cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed. She's very healthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not had measles, or chicken pox, or mumps, or any of those things yet?&rdquo;
       pursued the pleasant voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear!&rdquo; gasped Jewel. &ldquo;Please let me take Anna Belle.&rdquo; She caught her
      doll into her arms and met her companion's surprised gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any of them,&rdquo; he returned, amused. &ldquo;Don't be afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not afraid,&rdquo; answered the child promptly. &ldquo;There is nothing to be
      afraid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was only going to say,&rdquo; said the young man, &ldquo;that if she was ailing I
      could prescribe for her. I have my case right here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's startled look fell to the black case. &ldquo;What's that! Medicine?&rdquo; she
      asked softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is. So you see you have a doctor handy if anything ails the
      baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child gazed at him with grave scrutiny. &ldquo;Do you believe in materia
      medica?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young doctor threw back his head and laughed heartily. &ldquo;Well, yes,&rdquo; he
      answered at last. &ldquo;I am supposed to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To his surprise his neighbor returned to the attitude in which he had
      found her, with one hand over her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ceased laughing and looked at her in some discomfiture. Her mouth was
      set seriously. There was no quiver of the rosy lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      To his relief, in a minute she dropped her hand and began to hum and
      arrange her doll's hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The conductor approached, and as the doctor presented his ticket, he said,
      &ldquo;This little girl's fare is paid, I believe.&rdquo; The conductor nodded and
      passed on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm to get off at Bel-Air,&rdquo; said Jewel. &ldquo;I hope he doesn't forget.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he does, I shan't,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;for I'm going to get off there
      myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's eyes brightened. &ldquo;Isn't that nice!&rdquo; she returned. Then she
      lifted Anna Belle and whispered something into her ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No secrets,&rdquo; said the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just reminding Anna belle how we are always taken care of,&rdquo;
       returned Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man regarded her with increasing interest and curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you wonder how I knew that your fare was paid?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I met Mr. Evringham hurrying through the station. He said his
      granddaughter was on this train and asked me to look out for a little girl
      with a doll.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned the child, pleased, &ldquo;then you know grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've known him ever since I was no bigger than you are. But even then,&rdquo;
       added the doctor mentally, &ldquo;I hadn't supposed him capable of sending this
      baby out from the city alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel watched the kind eyes attentively. &ldquo;So you see,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;all I
      had to do was to look for Anna Belle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you nearly sat on her,&rdquo; declared the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I deny it,&rdquo; returned the doctor gravely. &ldquo;I deny it. You weren't looking.
      For one second I was afraid you were crying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Crying! What would I be crying for, coming to have a lovely visit at
      grandpa's!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you are in a hurry to see your aunt and cousin?&rdquo; remarked the
      doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I don't know them. You see,&rdquo; explanatorily, &ldquo;they aren't my real
      relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, aunt Madge is my uncle's wife and cousin Eloise is her little girl,
      but not uncle Lawrence's.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor thought a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really? She is a very charming little girl, is your cousin Eloise. Aren't
      you going to tell me your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I am Dr. Ballard, so now we are properly introduced.&rdquo; He smiled upon
      her with merry eyes, and she responded politely:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very glad you found us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at Bel-Air, the doctor picked up his case and Jewel followed him
      from the train. He looked about expectantly for Mrs. Evringham or her
      daughter. They were not there.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl's quick eyes discerned a light-haired driver and a brown
      horse coming around a curve of the pretty landscape gardening which
      beautified the station. At the same moment Dr. Ballard recognized the
      equipage with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've sent for you. That is all right,&rdquo; he said, and 'Zekiel, with one
      side glance at the little stranger, drew up by the platform.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Zeke. Here is your passenger.&rdquo; He lifted Jewel to her place
      beside the driver, whose smooth, stolid face did not change expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do I wait for Mr. Evringham?&rdquo; he asked, without turning his head in its
      stiff collar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mr. Evringham remained in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a trunk?&rdquo; pursued Zeke immovably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How about your trunk, little one?&rdquo; asked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel produced a paper check. &ldquo;A man gave grandpa this for it at the boat
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll see to having it sent up then.&rdquo; The doctor looked along the
      platform. &ldquo;It didn't come this trip.&rdquo; He took the child's hand in his. &ldquo;I
      shall see you again before long. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked after his retreating figure with some regret. Her present
      companion seemed carved out of wood. His plum-colored livery fitted
      without a wrinkle. His smooth, solemn face appeared incapable of speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      The swift horse trotted through the village street at a great pace, and
      the visitor enjoyed the novel experience so intensely that she could not
      forbear stealing a look up at the driver's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught it. &ldquo;Ain't afraid, are you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked doubtful. &ldquo;Is it error for the horse to go so fast?&rdquo; she
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Error?&rdquo; 'Zekiel regarded the child curiously. &ldquo;Well, I guess it's
      considered one o' the biggest virtues a horse can have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then why did you ask me if I was afraid? You're the third person who's
      asked me that this morning,&rdquo; returned Jewel, with wondering inflections in
      her soft voice. &ldquo;Are New York people afraid of things?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not so's you'd notice it as a rule,&rdquo; returned Zeke. &ldquo;I'm glad if
      she ain't one o' the scared kind,&rdquo; he pursued, as if to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this is splendid,&rdquo; declared Jewel, relieved by her companion's smile;
      &ldquo;I don't know as Anna Belle ever had such a good ride. See the trees,
      dearie! How the leaves are coming out! They aren't nearly so far out in
      Chicago; but oh,&rdquo; as the horse turned, &ldquo;there's a big storm coming! What a
      black cloud! We're just in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see any cloud,&rdquo; said Zeke, staring about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, right there in front of us,&rdquo; excitedly, pointing at the long opaque
      mass against the sky.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That? Why, that's hills.&rdquo; Zeke laughed. &ldquo;The mountain they call it here.
      Pretty sickly mountain we'd think it was up Berkshire way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's a mountain, Anna Belle,&rdquo; joyfully, &ldquo;we're really seeing a
      mountain!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No you ain't,&rdquo; remarked Zeke emphatically. &ldquo;Not by a large majority.
      Guess Chicago's some flat, ain't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We don't have hills, no. So now we're going to see grandpa's park, and
      the ravine, and the brook, and&mdash;and everything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke stole a furtive look at the owner of the joyous voice. The voluminous
      ribbon bows behind her ears were mostly in evidence, as she bent her face
      over her doll in congratulation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Left Mr. Evringham in town, did you?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he was busy, and in a hurry to get to his office. Grandpa's such an
      important man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he?&rdquo; asked Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why ye&mdash;es! Didn't you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I surmised something of the kind. So Dr. Ballard looked after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&mdash;and I do hope my trunk will come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked wistfully at the driver. In spite of his stiff and elegant
      appearance he had been surprisingly affable. &ldquo;I have a checked silk
      dress,&rdquo; she added modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say so!&rdquo; ejaculated Zeke, wholly won by the smile bent upon
      him. &ldquo;Well, now, if that trunk don't show up by noon, I'll have to do
      something about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; exclaimed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      They now sped through the gates of the park and by the porter's lodge, and
      began the ascent of a winding road. Handsome residences were set among the
      fine trees, and at sight of each one Jewel looked expectant and eager.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I expect mother'll be kind of looking out for us,&rdquo; continued Zeke. &ldquo;Poor
      kid!&rdquo; he added mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa said something about your mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His housekeeper, Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, of course I know about Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; returned Jewel hastily and
      politely. &ldquo;He told me your name too,&rdquo; she added suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm Zeke. And you just remember,&rdquo; emphatically, &ldquo;that I come when
      I'm called. Will you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the child, laughing a little. &ldquo;Do you know my name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Julia, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but if you called me by it perhaps I shouldn't come, for I'm used to
      the name of Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty name, all right,&rdquo; returned Zeke sententiously. &ldquo;Now you can see
      your grandpa's house. The one with the long porch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel jumped up and down a little in the seat and held Anna Belle to get a
      good view. The brown horse trotted with a will, and in a minute more they
      had passed up the driveway and paused beneath the <i>porte-cochere</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes threw open the door and stood unsmiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Mr. Evringham?&rdquo; she asked, addressing her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stayed in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper stepped forward and helped down the little girl, who had
      risen and was looking brightly expectant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you do, Julia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Did you come out alone on the cars?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Dr. Ballard came with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was the way of it. Zeke, hitch up the brougham. The ladies are
      going out to lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't they let me know?&rdquo; grumbled Zeke. &ldquo;Could have hitched up the
      brougham just as well in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask <i>me</i>,&rdquo; returned his mother acidly. &ldquo;Where is your bag,
      Julia? I hope you haven't left it in the train?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't have any. I used mother's. She knew I'd have my trunk
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then come in and I'll show you where your room is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked eagerly and admiringly from side to side as she followed
      Mrs. Forbes up two flights of broad shallow stairs and into an apartment
      which to her eyes seemed luxurious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this ever my father's room?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes, I believe it was,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes, to whom that
      circumstance had not before occurred.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind of grandpa to let me have it!&rdquo; said Jewel, highly pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wasn't in it much, your father wasn't. Away at school or some other
      place mostly. Where's your trunk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's coming. Zeke said he'd attend to it.&rdquo; Jewel looked up happily. &ldquo;I
      have a&rdquo;&mdash;she was intending to communicate to Mrs. Forbes the exciting
      detail of her wardrobe when the housekeeper interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son's name is Ezekiel,&rdquo; she said impressively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned Jewel abashed. &ldquo;He told me Zeke.&rdquo; She still stood in the
      middle of the large white room, Anna Belle in her arms, and with the
      surprised look in her serious face drew upon herself an unflattering
      mental comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The image of Harry,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can I see aunt Madge and cousin Eloise?&rdquo; asked the child, beginning to
      feel some awe of the large woman regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're getting ready to go out to lunch. They can't be disturbed now.
      You can sit here, or walk around until lunch time. You'll know when that
      is ready, because the gong will sound in the hall. Now when you go
      downstairs be careful not to touch the tall clock on the landing. That is
      a very valuable chiming clock, and you mustn't open its doors, for fear
      you would break something. Then if you go into the parlor you must never
      play on the piano unless you ask somebody, for fear Mr. Evringham might be
      trying to take a nap just at that time; then you mustn't go into the barn
      without permission, for it's dangerous where the horses are, and you might
      get kicked. If you're tired from your journey you can lie down now till
      lunch time; but whenever you do lie down, be sure to turn off this white
      spread, for fear you might soil it. Now I'm very busy, and I shan't see
      you again till lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes departed and Jewel stood for half a minute motionless, feeling
      rather dazed by a novel sensation of resentment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As if we were babies!&rdquo; she whispered to her doll. &ldquo;She's the most afraid
      woman I ever saw, and she looks so <i>sorry</i>! She isn't our relation,
      so no matter, dearie, what she says. This is father's room, and we can
      think how he used to run around here when he was a little boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tiptoeing to the door, Jewel closed it and began to inspect her new
      apartment.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sweet smelling soap on the marble stand, the silver mountings of the
      faucets, the large fine towels, the empty closet and drawers, all looked
      inviting. Throughout her examination the little girl kept pausing to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Surely aunt Madge and cousin Eloise would look in before they went out to
      their engagement. Mother had so often said how nice it was that they were
      there. Surely they didn't know that she had arrived. That was it, of
      course; and Mrs. Forbes was so sorry and anxious she would probably forget
      to tell them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some altercation was just then going on in the apartments of those ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We ought to speak to her before we go,&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham persuasively.
      &ldquo;Father would probably resent it if we didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have told you already,&rdquo; returned Eloise, &ldquo;that I do not intend doing
      one thing henceforward that grandfather could interpret as being done to
      please him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is carrying it ridiculously far, not to greet your cousin, who
      has come from a journey and is your guest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My guest!&rdquo; returned the girl derisively. &ldquo;We are hers more likely. I will
      not go to her. The sooner grandfather sends us away the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked worried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is mania, Eloise!&rdquo; she returned coaxingly. &ldquo;Very well, I shall go
      and speak to the child. She shan't be able to tell her grandfather of any
      rudeness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes Jewel, sitting by her window, Anna Belle in her lap,
      heard the <i>frou-frou</i> of skirts in the hall, and with a knock at the
      door, a lady entered. She was arrayed in a thin black gown and wore a
      large black hat, that was very becoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's admiration went out to her on the instant and she started up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The lady swept toward her, and bending, a delicate perfume wafted about
      Jewel as she felt a light touch of lips on her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So this is Julia Evringham,&rdquo; said the newcomer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you are aunt Madge,&rdquo; returned the child gladly, clinging to the
      gloved hand, which endured for a moment, and then firmly disengaged
      itself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father and mother got off all right I hope?&rdquo; went on the airy voice.
      &ldquo;I'm always afraid of winds at this season myself, but they may not have
      them. Your cousin Eloise and I are hurrying away to a luncheon, but we
      shall see you at dinner. You're very comfortable here? That's right.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She swept away, and the light again faded from Jewel's face as she went
      slowly back to her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Madge is afraid, too,&rdquo; she said to the doll. &ldquo;We know there won't be
      winds, don't we, dearie? God will take care of father and mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An uncomfortable lump rose towards the child's throat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham followed Eloise into the brougham, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It couldn't be better,&rdquo; she announced with much satisfaction as they
      drove away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is plain&mdash;oh, plain as possible. Small eyes, large mouth,
      insignificant nose. She will never get on with father. He never could
      endure ugliness in a girl or woman. I have heard him say it was
      unpardonable. If it hadn't been that we were what we are, Eloise, I should
      never have dreamed of doing as I have done. Now if only some good fairy
      would open your eyes to see which side your bread is buttered on! You
      could do marvels with such a foil for contrast.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FIRST EVENING
    </h3>
    <p>
      In the excitement of the early morning start, Jewel had eaten little
      breakfast, but the soft resonance of the Japanese gong, when it sounded in
      the hall below, found her unready for food.
    </p>
    <p>
      However, she judged the mellow sound to be her summons and obediently left
      her seat by the window. As she went down she looked askance at the tall
      dark clock which, even as she passed, chimed the half hour melodiously.
      Certainly her important grandfather lived in a wonderful house. She paused
      to hear the last notes of the bells, but catching sight of the figure of
      Mrs. Forbes waiting below, she started and moved on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right. Come along,&rdquo; said the housekeeper. &ldquo;Mr. Evringham likes
      everybody to be punctual in his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, has grandpa come home?&rdquo; inquired Jewel eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he won't be home for hours yet. Come this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl followed to the dining-room, which she thought quite as
      wonderful as the clock; but her admiration of all she saw was no longer
      unmixed. Mrs. Forbes seemed to cast a shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      One place was laid at the table, one handsome chair was drawn up to it.
      Jewel longed to call Anna Belle's attention to the glittering array on the
      sideboard and behind the crystal doors of cabinets, but something withheld
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked questioningly at the housekeeper. &ldquo;I think I'll draw up another
      chair for Anna Belle,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes had already decided, from small signs of assurance, that this
      Western child was bold. &ldquo;Give her an inch, and she'll take an ell,&rdquo; she
      had said to herself. &ldquo;I know her sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean the doll?&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Put it down anywhere. You must
      never bring it to the table. Mr. Evringham wouldn't like it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In silence Jewel seated the doll in the nearest chair against the wall,
      and as she slid up into her own, a neat maid appeared with a puffy and
      appetizing omelet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes filled the child's glass with water, and the maid set down the
      omelet and departed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's heart sank while Mrs. Forbes presented the souffle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry,&rdquo; she began hesitatingly, &ldquo;I never&mdash;I can't&rdquo;&mdash;then
      she swallowed hard in her desperate plight. &ldquo;Isn't it pretty?&rdquo; she said
      rather breathlessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very good,&rdquo; returned the housekeeper briefly, misconstruing the
      child's hesitation. &ldquo;Shall I help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;could I have a drink of milk? I don't&mdash;I don't eat eggs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't eat eggs?&rdquo; repeated the housekeeper severely. &ldquo;I'm sorry you have
      been allowed to be notional. Children should eat what is set before them.
      Taste of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I couldn't, please.&rdquo; Jewel's face was averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes touched an electric bell. The maid reappeared. &ldquo;Remove the
      omelet, Sarah, and bring Miss Julia a glass of milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That was the order, but oh, the tone of it! Jewel's heart beat a little
      faster as she took some bread and butter and drank the milk, Mrs. Forbes
      standing by, a portentous, solemn, black-robed figure, awful in its
      silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the child set down the glass empty, she started to push back her
      chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes laconically. She again touched an electric bell.
      The maid reappeared, removed the bread and milk and served a dainty
      dessert of preserved peaches, cream, and cake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've really had enough,&rdquo; said Jewel politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you eat peaches and cream, or cake either?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Forbes
      accusingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; returned the child, and ate them without further ado.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your trunk has come,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes when at last Jewel slipped down
      from the table. &ldquo;I will come up and help you unpack it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If only she wouldn't!&rdquo; thought the child as she lifted Anna Belle, but
      the housekeeper preceded her up the stairs, breathing rather heavily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sure enough, when they reached the white room, there stood the new trunk
      that had been packed with so much anticipation. The bright black letters
      on the side, J. E., had power even now to send a little glow of pride
      through its possessor. She stole a glance at Mrs. Forbes, but, strange as
      it may appear, the housekeeper gave no evidence of admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't need to trouble you, Mrs. Forbes. I can unpack it,&rdquo; said the
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm up here now, and anyway, I'd better show you where to keep your
      things. Where's your key?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel laid down the doll and opened her leather side-bag, producing the
      key tied with a little ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes unlocked the trunk, lifted out the tray, and began in a
      business-like manner to dispose of the small belongings that had last been
      handled so tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Harry certainly knows how to pack,&rdquo; ran her thoughts, &ldquo;and she'd
      naturally know how to sew. These things are as neat as wax, and the
      child's well fixed.&rdquo; In the tray, among other things, were a number of
      doll's clothes, some writing materials, a box of different colored hair
      ribbons, and a few books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glad to see a Bible,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;Shows Mrs. Harry is
      respectable.&rdquo; She glanced at the three other books. One was a copy of
      &ldquo;Heidi,&rdquo; one was &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland,&rdquo; and the third a small black book
      with the design of a cross and crown in gilt on the cover. Mrs. Forbes
      looked from this up at the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this? Some kind of a daily book, Julia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;yes, I read it every day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you'll be faithful now your mother's gone. She's taken the
      trouble to put it in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eyes had caught a glimpse of green color. Eagerly she reached down
      into the trunk and drew out carefully a dress in tiny checks of green and
      white.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my silk dress,&rdquo; she said, regarding it fondly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is very neatly made,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes repressively. &ldquo;It doesn't
      matter at all what little girls have on if they are clean and neat. It
      only matters that they shall be obedient and good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel regarded her with the patience which children exercise toward the
      inevitable. &ldquo;I'd like to fix Anna Belle's drawer myself,&rdquo; she said
      modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, you may. Now here are your shoes and slippers, but I don't
      find any rubbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never wear rubbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Doesn't it rain in Chicago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes indeed, it rains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you must get your feet wet. I think you better have had rubbers than
      a silk dress! What was your mother thinking of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel sighed vaguely. She wondered how soon Mrs. Forbes would go away.
    </p>
    <p>
      This happy event occurred before long, and the little girl amused herself
      for a while with rearranging somewhat the closet and drawers. Then putting
      on her hat and taking her doll with her, she stole quietly down the
      thickly carpeted stairs, and opening the heavy hall door, went out upon
      the piazza. It was sheltered from the wind, and wicker chairs were
      scattered about. Jewel looked off curiously amid the trees to where she
      knew, by her father's description, she should find, after a few minutes'
      ramble, the ravine and brook. Pretty soon she would wander out there. Just
      now the sun was warm here, and the roomy chairs held out inviting arms.
      The child climbed into one of them. Father would come back here some happy
      day and find her. The thought brought a smile, and with the smile on her
      lips, her head fell back against a yielding cushion, and in a minute she
      had fallen asleep. Anna Belle toppled over backward. Her plumed hat was
      pushed rakishly askew, but little she cared. Her eyelids had fallen, too.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham and Eloise, returning late from their luncheon, came upon
      the little sleeping figure as they walked around the long piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There she is!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham softly, putting up her lorgnette.
      &ldquo;Behold your rival!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise regarded the sleeper without curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At least she has not come uninvited,&rdquo; was her only comment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she has come unwelcome, my dear,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham with
      relish. &ldquo;Just wait until our gracious host realizes what he has let
      himself in for. Oh, there's a good time coming, you may be sure. Hush,
      don't waken her! It would be a blessed dispensation if she were always to
      sleep while her grandfather is absent,&rdquo; and Mrs. Evringham led the way
      into the house, her laces fluttering.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the first landing the ladies met Mrs. Forbes, troubled of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am looking for the child Julia,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I can't think where she can
      have disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've not far to seek,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham airily. &ldquo;She is asleep
      on the piazza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes hastened downstairs and out of doors. Glancing
      about she quickly perceived the short legs stretched in a reclining chair,
      and advanced toward the relaxed little figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia, wake up!&rdquo; she said, touching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child stirred and opened her eyes. Her movement made the doll slip to
      the floor, and this caused her to come to herself suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I fell asleep, didn't I?&rdquo; she said drowsily, reaching for the doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and in Mr. Evringham's own chair!&rdquo; responded Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're all his, aren't they?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but this is his special favorite, where he always lies to rest.
      Remember!&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;Come right upstairs now and change your
      dress for dinner. He will be coming home in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good!&rdquo; exclaimed Jewel with satisfaction, and passed into the house.
      Mrs. Forbes was following ponderously. &ldquo;Oh, you don't need to come with
      me,&rdquo; protested the child earnestly. &ldquo;I can do it all myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you sure?&rdquo; doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ye&mdash;es!&rdquo; replied the little girl, running lightly up the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to put her on the second floor,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Forbes, &ldquo;if I've got
      to be running up and down; but I suppose she has done for herself a great
      deal. I suppose the mother hadn't time to be bothered. I'd like to make
      Mamzell change rooms with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel hummed a tune as she took off her sailor suit, performed her
      ablutions, and then went to her closet to choose a frock for dinner. She
      decided on a blue dress with white dots chiefly because she would not have
      to change her hair ribbons. She had never herself tied those voluminous
      bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she was ready and danced toward the door, but some novel timidity
      made her hesitate and go back sedately to the chair by the window. Mrs.
      Forbes's impressive figure seemed to loom up with an order to her to wait
      the summons of the gong.
    </p>
    <p>
      She sat there for what seemed a very long time, and at last a knock
      sounded at the door. Perhaps grandpa had come up. Jewel flew to open to
      him&mdash;and saw the white capped maid who had appeared at luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are all at table, and Mr. Evringham wishes you to come down,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I was waiting for the gong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We only have that at noon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's feet flew down the stairs. Her grandfather had sent for her. She
      was eager to reach him, yet when she entered the dining-room, her little
      face all alight, it was not so easy to run to him as she had fancied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat stiffly at the foot of the table. Opposite him was aunt Madge, and
      at her left sat the prettiest young lady the child had ever seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes stood near Mr. Evringham, looking very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel took in all this at a glance, and contenting herself with greeting
      her grandfather's lifted eyes with a smile, she ran to Mrs. Evringham and
      turned her back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's just one button in the middle, aunt Madge, that I can't reach,&rdquo;
       she explained softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Every eye at the table was regarding the child curiously, but she took no
      note of any one but her grandfather, and her dress buttoned, she ran to
      her chair and slid up on its smooth morocco. Eloise observed the little
      girl's loving expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am sorry you are late, Julia,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so am I, grandpa,&rdquo; was the prompt response. &ldquo;I wanted to be down
      here as soon as you came home, but I thought I ought to wait for the gong,
      and then it didn't ring.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes roved to where, directly opposite, the beautiful young lady was
      regarding her soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham spoke. &ldquo;That is your cousin Eloise, Julia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise inclined her graceful head, but made no further recognition of the
      child's admiring look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They haven't met before?&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham, looking from one to the
      other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham with her most gracious manner. &ldquo;It just
      happened that Eloise and I were engaged at luncheon to-day, and when we
      returned the little girl was taking a nap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By this time Mrs. Forbes had brought Jewel's soup and she was eating. She
      looked up brightly at Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, grandpa, I went to sleep in your big chair on the piazza. I didn't
      know it was your special chair until Mrs. Forbes waked me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grandfather regarded her from under his heavy brows. He was resenting
      the fact that Eloise had made no effort to welcome the child. &ldquo;Indeed?&rdquo; he
      returned. &ldquo;What did she wake you up for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because it was time to get ready for dinner,&rdquo; returned Jewel. &ldquo;It
      reminded me of the story of Golden Hair, when she had gone to sleep on the
      bear's bed, the way Mrs. Forbes said, 'This is your grandfather's chair!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked around the table, expectant of sympathy. Only Mrs. Evringham
      seemed to wish to laugh, and she was making heroic efforts not to do so.
      Lovely Eloise kept her serious eyes downcast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Evringham, after a lightning glance of suspicion at
      his daughter-in-law. &ldquo;I think I remember something about that. But Golden
      Hair tried three beds, I believe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she did, but you see there wasn't any little bear's chair on the
      piazza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very true. Very true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Golden Hair was a great beauty, I believe,&rdquo; suggested Mrs. Evringham,
      looking at the child oddly. &ldquo;She had yellow hair like yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel put up a quick hand to the short tight braid which ended behind her
      ear. &ldquo;Oh no, long, lovely, floating hair. Don't you remember?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a good while since I read it,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham, laughing low
      and glancing at Eloise. Her father-in-law sent her a look of displeasure
      and turned back to Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Ballard found you on the train, I suppose?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, grandpa. We had a nice time. He is a very kind man.&rdquo; The child
      glanced across at her cousin again. She wished cousin Eloise would lift
      her eyes and not look so sorry. &ldquo;I wonder,&rdquo; she added aloud, &ldquo;why Dr.
      Ballard called cousin Eloise a little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one spoke, so Mrs. Evringham broke the momentary silence. &ldquo;Did he?&rdquo; she
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said that my cousin Eloise was a very charming little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel wondered why Eloise flushed and looked still sorrier, and why aunt
      Madge raised her napkin and turned her laugh into a cough. Perhaps it
      teased young ladies to be called little girls. Jewel regretted having
      mentioned it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he was just April-fooling me,&rdquo; she suggested comfortingly, and
      the insistence of her soft gaze was such that Eloise looked up and met a
      smile so irresistible, that in spite of herself, her expression relaxed.
    </p>
    <p>
      The softened look was a relief to the child. &ldquo;I've heard about you, of
      course, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and I couldn't forget, because your
      name is so nice and&mdash;and slippery. Eloise Evringham. Eloise
      Evringham. It sounds just like&mdash;like&mdash;oh, like sliding down the
      banisters. Don't you think so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise smiled a little. &ldquo;I hadn't thought of it,&rdquo; she returned, then
      relapsed into quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes's countenance was stony. &ldquo;Children should be seen and not
      heard,&rdquo; was her doctrine, and this dressmaker's child had an assurance
      beyond belief. She seemed to feel no awe whatever in her grandfather's
      presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper caught Jewel's eye and gave her such a quenching look that
      thenceforward the little girl succumbed to the silence which the others
      seemed to prefer.
    </p>
    <p>
      After dinner she would have a good visit with grandpa and talk about when
      father was a little boy. Her hopes were dashed, for just as they were
      rising from the table, a man was announced, with whom Mr. Evringham
      closeted himself in the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the drawing-room aunt Madge and cousin Eloise both set themselves at
      letter-writing, and entirely ignored Jewel. The child looked listlessly at
      a book with pictures, which she found on the table, until half-past eight,
      when Mrs. Forbes came to say it was time for her to go to bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      She rose and stood a moment, turning hesitatingly from her aunt to her
      cousin.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is it bedtime?&rdquo; asked aunt Madge, looking up from her letter.
      &ldquo;Good-night, Julia. I hope you'll sleep well.&rdquo; Then she returned to her
      writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise bit her lip as she regarded the little girl with a moment's
      hesitation, but no, she had decided on her plan of action. Mrs. Forbes was
      observing her. Eloise knew the housekeeper's attitude toward them was
      defensive, if not offensive. &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; she said briefly, and looked
      down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; returned Jewel quietly, and went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the hall she hesitated. &ldquo;I want to say good-night to grandpa,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can't,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes decidedly. &ldquo;He is talking business
      and mustn't be disturbed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She followed the child up the staircase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could go to bed alone, if I only knew where the matches are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you could dress alone, but you had to ask Mrs. Evringham to
      button your frock. Remember after this that I am the one to ask. She and
      Miss Eloise don't want to be bothered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a bother to do a kindness?&rdquo; asked Jewel in a subdued tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To some folks it is,&rdquo; was the response. They had reached the door of the
      child's room; &ldquo;but some folks can see their duty and do it,&rdquo; she added
      virtuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel realized regretfully that her present companion belonged to the
      latter class.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now here, right inside the door,&rdquo; proceeded Mrs. Forbes, &ldquo;is the switch.
      There's electricity all over this house, and you don't need any matches.
      See?&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes turned the switch and the white room was flooded with
      light.
    </p>
    <p>
      A few hours ago this magic would have evoked much enthusiasm. Even now
      Jewel was pleased to turn the light on and off several times, as Mrs.
      Forbes told her to do.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I'll see if you can undress yourself,&rdquo; said the housekeeper. Jewel's
      deft fingers flew over the buttons in her eagerness to prove her
      independence. When at last she stood in her little white nightgown, so
      neat and fine in its small decorations, Mrs. Forbes said, &ldquo;Do you want me
      to hear you say your prayers?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I thank you.&rdquo; With her hasty response Jewel promptly jumped into the
      bed, from which the white spread had been removed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you always say them,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes, regarding her undecidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, I always do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child cuddled down under the covers with her face to the wall, lest
      Mrs. Forbes should see a further duty and do it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to say them on your knees,&rdquo; continued the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd just as lief,&rdquo; replied Jewel, &ldquo;but I don't believe God cares.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes solemnly, &ldquo;it is a matter for your own
      conscience, Julia, if your mother didn't train you to it. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night,&rdquo; came faintly from beneath the bedclothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes turned off the light and went out, closing the door behind
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she'd always speak when she's spoken to, and be quiet and modest as
      she is with me, she'd be a very well-behaved child,&rdquo; she soliloquized. &ldquo;I
      could train her. I shouldn't wonder at all if her mother should see a
      great difference in her when she comes back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper went heavily downstairs. Jewel, pushing off the
      bedclothes, listened attentively to the retiring steps, and when they
      could no longer be heard, she jumped out of bed nimbly, and feeling for
      the electric switch, turned on the light. Her breath was coming rather
      unevenly, and she ran over the soft carpet to where her doll lay. Catching
      her up, she pressed her to her breast, then sitting down in the big chair,
      she began to undress her, crossing one little bare foot over the other
      knee to make a lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling Anna Belle, did you think I'd forgotten you?&rdquo; she asked
      breathlessly. &ldquo;Did you think you weren't going to have any one to kiss you
      good-night? It's hard not to have any one you love kiss you good-night.&rdquo;
       Jewel dashed her hand across her eyes quickly, then went swiftly on with
      her work. &ldquo;You might have known that I was only waiting until that&mdash;that
      giantess went away. She wouldn't let me bring you down to dinner, dearie,
      but you didn't miss anything. Poor grandpa, I don't wonder any longer that
      he doesn't look happy. He has the sorriest people all around him that you
      ever saw. He lives in a big, beautiful castle, but it's Castle Discord. I
      named it that at dinner. Nobody loves one another. Of course grandpa loves
      me, because I'm his own little grandchild, but he's too sorry to show it.
      The beautiful enchanted maiden, and the Error fairy, and the giantess, are
      all making discord around him. A little flat is better than a big castle,
      isn't it? We know a flat&mdash;let's call it Harmony Flat, Anna Belle.
      Perhaps if we're very, <i>very</i>, good, we'll get back there some time.&rdquo;
       Jewel suddenly pressed the doll's nightdress against her wet eyes. &ldquo;Don't,
      don't, dearie! I know it does seem a year since&mdash;since the boat this
      morning. If all the days were as long as this, we'd be very, very old when
      father and mother come home.&rdquo; The soft voice broke in a sob. &ldquo;I don't know
      what I should do if you weren't a Christian Scientist, Anna Belle. We'll
      help each other all we can. Now come&mdash;come into bed and say your
      prayers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say your&mdash;your prayer first, dearie,&rdquo; she whispered, sobbing:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;'Father, Mother, God,
     Loving me,&mdash;
     Guard me when I sleep;
     Guide my little feet
     Up to Thee.'
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you'll feel&mdash;better, dearie. In a minute you won't be so&mdash;homesick
      for&mdash;for&mdash;father and mother. Hush, while I say mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel repeated the Lord's Prayer. When she had finished, her breath still
      caught convulsively, so she continued:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear Father, Mother, God, loving me, help me to know that I am close to
      Thee. Help me to remember that things that are unhappy aren't real things.
      Help me to know that everything is good and harmonious, and that the
      people in this castle are Thy children, even if they do seem to have eyes
      like fishes. Help me to love one another, even the giantess, and please
      show grandpa how to meet error. Please let Dr. Ballard come to see me
      soon, because he has kind eyes, and I'm sure he doesn't know it's wrong to
      believe in materia medica. Please take more care of father and mother than
      anything, and say 'Peace be still' if the wind blows the sea. I know, dear
      Father in Heaven, that Thou dost not forget anything, but I say it to make
      me feel better. I am Thy little Jewel, and Anna Belle loves Thee, too.
      Take us into the everlasting arms of Love while we go to sleep. Amen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel brushed away the tears as she ceased, and with her usual quickness
      of motion, jumped out of bed to get a handkerchief. Turning on the
      electric light, she went to the chair over which hung the dotted dress.
      She remembered having slipped a clean handkerchief into its pocket before
      going to dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      In reaching for it her fingers encountered a scrap of paper in the depths
      of the pocket. She drew it forth. It was folded. She opened it and found
      it written over in a clear round hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is my little darling loving every one around her? People do not always
      seem lovely at first, but remember that every one is lovable because he is
      a thought of God. Those who seem unlovely are always unhappy, too, in
      their hearts. We must help them, and the best way to help is to love.
      Mother is thinking about her little Jewel, and no seas can divide us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slow smile gladdened the child's tear-stained face. She read the message
      again, then turned out the light for the last time and cuddled down in
      bed, her warm cheek pressing the scrap of paper in her hand, her breath
      still catching.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother has spoken to us, Anna Belle,&rdquo; she whispered, clasping the doll
      close. &ldquo;Wasn't it just like God to let her!&rdquo; Then she fell asleep smiling.

      CHAPTER VIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A HAPPY BREAKFAST
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes was on the porch next morning when Mr. Evringham returned from
      his canter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Fine morning, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; he said, as he gave Essex Maid into Zeke's
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very fine. A regular weather breeder. It'll most probably rain to-morrow,
      and what I wanted to speak to you about, Mr. Evringham, is, that the child
      hasn't any rubbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? What else does she need?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, nothing that I can see. Her things are all good, and she's got
      enough of them. The trouble is she says she has never worn rubbers and
      doesn't want to, and if she gets sick I shall have to take care of her; so
      I hope, sir, you'll say that she must have them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not wear them? Of course she must wear them,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham
      brusquely. &ldquo;Get them to-day, if convenient, Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper looked relieved.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope she's not making you any trouble, eh?&rdquo; added Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not any more than she can help, I suppose,&rdquo; was the grudging reply.
      &ldquo;She's a smart child, and being an only one, she's some notional. She
      won't eat this and that, and doesn't want to wear rubbers, but she's handy
      and neat, and is used to doing for herself; her mother hasn't had time to
      fuss with her, of course, and that's lucky for me. She seems very well
      behaved, considering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel had made heroic efforts while Mrs. Forbes assisted at her morning
      toilet, and this was her reward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we mustn't have you imposed upon,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham, feeling
      guilty of the situation. &ldquo;The child must obey you implicitly, implicitly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying he passed into the house, and after making a change in his
      toilet, entered the dining-room. There he was seated, deep in his
      newspaper and waiting for his coffee, when the door opened, light feet ran
      to him, and an arm was thrown around his neck. He looked up to meet a
      happy smile, and before he could realize who had captured him, Jewel
      pressed a fervent kiss upon his cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, grandpa, how nice and cold your cheek feels! Have you been out doors
      already?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham could feel the said cheek grow hot in surprise at this
      onslaught. He held himself stiffly and uncomfortably in the encircling
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've been out on horseback,&rdquo; he returned shortly. &ldquo;I go every
      morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eyes sparkled. &ldquo;Oh, I'm so glad. Then I can watch you. I love to
      see anybody ride. When I see a beautiful horse something inside me gets
      warm. Father says I like just the same things he does. I must let you read
      your paper, grandpa, but may I say one thing more?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't come last evening to kiss you good-night because you had
      somebody with you in the library, and, the giant&mdash;and Mrs. Forbes
      wouldn't let me; but I wanted to. You know I wanted to, don't you? I felt
      all sorry inside because I couldn't. You know you're the only real
      relation I have in the castle&rdquo;&mdash;Here Mrs. Forbes's entrance with the
      coffee interrupted the confidence, and Jewel, with a last surreptitious
      squeeze of Mr. Evringham's neck, intended to finish her sentence
      eloquently, left him and went to her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're to sit here this morning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes, indicating the place
      opposite her employer. &ldquo;Mrs. Evringham and her daughter don't come down to
      breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked up eagerly. &ldquo;Not ever?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child shot a radiant glance across at her grandfather which he caught,
      the thread of his business calculations having been hopelessly broken.
      &ldquo;Oh, grandpa, we're always going to have breakfast alone together!&rdquo; she
      said joyously. Noting Mrs. Forbes's set countenance, she added
      apologetically, &ldquo;They're so pretty, cousin Eloise and aunt Madge, I love
      to look at them, but they aren't my real relations, and,&rdquo; her face
      gladdening again, &ldquo;to think of having breakfast alone with you, grandpa,
      makes me feel as if&mdash;as if I had a birthday!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham cleared his throat. The situation might have been a little
      easier if Mrs. Forbes had not been present, but as it was, he had never
      felt so embarrassed in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now eat your oatmeal, Julia,&rdquo; said the housekeeper repressively. &ldquo;Mr.
      Evringham always reads his paper at breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the child with docility. She poured the cream from a small
      silver pitcher with a neatness that won Mrs. Forbes's approval; and Mr.
      Evringham read over headlines in the paper, while he sipped his coffee,
      without understanding in the least the meaning of the words. Mrs. Forbes
      was right. Discipline must be maintained. This was the time during which
      he wished to read his paper, and it was most astonishing to be so
      vigorously taken possession of by an utter stranger. Now was the time to
      repress her if she were to be repressed. Mrs. Forbes was right. After a
      while he glanced across at the child. She looked very small and clean, and
      she was ready with a quick smile for him; but she put a little forefinger
      against her lips jocosely. He cleared his throat again and averted his
      eyes, rumpling the paper as he turned a leaf.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes left the room with the oatmeal dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel leaned forward quickly. &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; she said earnestly, &ldquo;if you would
      declare every day, over and over, that no error could come near your
      house, I think she would go away of her own accord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham stared, open paper in hand. &ldquo;What? Who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away? Mrs. Forbes? What are you thinking of! I couldn't get on without
      Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jewel leaned back with the long-drawn exclamation. &ldquo;I thought she
      was what made you look sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No indeed. I have enough things to make me sorry, but she isn't one of
      them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like her?&rdquo; wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;why&mdash;I respect her profoundly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! It must be lots easier to respect her pro&mdash;the way you do, than
      to like her; but,&rdquo; with firm lips, &ldquo;I've got to love her. I told Anna
      Belle so this morning, and especially if you want her to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless my soul!&rdquo; Mr. Evringham looked in dismay as his <i>vis-à-vis</i>.
      &ldquo;You must be very careful, Julia, not to offend or trouble her in any
      way,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, grandpa, I will, and then will you do me a favor too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I must hear it first.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind calling me Jewel? You know it isn't any matter about the
      rest, because they're not my real relations, but Julia is mother's name,
      and Jewel is mine; and when I love people very much, I like them to call
      me Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes here entered with a tray, and Mr. Evringham merely said, &ldquo;Very
      well,&rdquo; twice over, and retreated into his newspaper.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the tray were boiled eggs. Jewel glanced quickly up at Mrs. Forbes's
      impassive face. She might have remembered. Probably she did remember.
    </p>
    <p>
      Life had not taught the child to be shy, as has been evidenced; so
      although Mrs. Forbes was an awing experience, she felt strong in the
      presence of her important grandfather, and only kept silence now in order
      not to interrupt his reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      When at last he laid down his paper and began to chip an egg, Jewel
      glanced at those which Mrs. Forbes had set before her. Her little face had
      grown very serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, do you think it's error for me not to like eggs?&rdquo; she asked.
      &ldquo;Mother never said it was. She was willing I should eat something else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, eat whatever you like,&rdquo; responded Mr. Evringham quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes seemed to swell and grow pink. &ldquo;You always have eggs, sir, and
      if there's two breakfasts to be got, will you kindly tell me what the
      other shall be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham glanced up in some surprise at the unfamiliar tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the oatmeal is a plenty,&rdquo; said Jewel, looking at the housekeeper,
      eager to mollify her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try an egg. Perhaps you'll like them by this time,&rdquo; suggested Mr.
      Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like everything to eat, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, being most arbitrary and peculiar in his tastes, could only
      gain time by clearing his throat again, and taking a drink of coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes will bring you a glass of milk, I dare say,&rdquo; he returned at
      last, without looking up; and the housekeeper turned with ponderous
      obedience and left the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nimbly Jewel slid down from her chair, and running around the table to her
      grandfather's place, put both her arms around his neck and whispered to
      him eagerly and swiftly, &ldquo;If you have such a pro&mdash;something respect
      for Mrs. Forbes, and it makes her sorry because I won't eat eggs, perhaps
      I ought to. If it offends thy brother to have you eat meat, you mustn't,
      the Bible says, so I suppose, if it makes Mrs. Forbes turn red and perhaps
      get the stomach ache to have me not eat eggs, I ought to; but grandpa, if
      you decide I must, please let me wait till to-morrow morning, so I can say
      the Scientific Statement of Being all day&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Mrs. Forbes entered with a glass of milk on a little tray. She stood
      transfixed at the sight that met her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That child hasn't the fear of man before her eyes!&rdquo; she ejaculated
      mentally, then she marched forward and deposited the milk beside Jewel's
      empty plate, while the child ran back and took her seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, gazing at his visitor in mute astonishment, was much
      disconcerted to receive a confiding gesture of raised shoulders and
      eyebrows, which, combined with a little smile, plainly signified that they
      had been caught. He took up his newspaper mechanically.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had never had a daughter, and caresses had seldom passed between him
      and his children. His duties as a family man had always been perfunctory.
      He was tingling now from the surprise of Jewel's action, the feeling of
      the little gingham clad arms about his neck, the touch of the rose-leaf
      skin as she swept his cheek and ear in her emphatic half-whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      His mental processes were stiff when the subject related to things apart
      from the stock market, his horses, and golf, but he was finally
      understanding that his granddaughter had come to Bel-Air, prepared by
      accounts which had cast a glamour over everything and everybody in it. She
      had evidently found Mrs. Forbes fall below her expectations. He had been
      disillusioned concerning Mrs. Evringham and Eloise. As yet the halo with
      which he himself had been invested was intact. Was it to remain so? He
      still saw how foolish he had been to send for the child. He still wished,
      of course, that she was in Chicago now, instead of sitting across there
      from him in crisp short skirts, her head and shoulders only showing above
      the high table, and a little smile of good understanding waiting for him
      each time he looked up.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had done very well during a lifetime without being hugged, yet the
      innocent incense, which had been rising spontaneously before him ever
      since the child entered the dining-room, had a strangely sweet savor. Such
      was the joy of breakfast alone with him that it made her feel as if she
      had a birthday! Perfectly absurd! Quite the most absurd thing that he had
      ever heard in his life.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes spoke. &ldquo;Perhaps it is to be the same way about the rubbers,
      Mr. Evringham!&rdquo; she said, much flushed. &ldquo;Perhaps you will not insist upon
      Julia wearing rubbers!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, yes, certainly,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham hastily, anxious to
      reinstate himself. &ldquo;I wish you to have a pair of rubbers at once, Julia&mdash;Jewel.
      You surely don't mean that your mother has allowed you to wet your feet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I never noticed, grandpa, but,&rdquo; hopefully, &ldquo;she lets me wet my
      hands, so why not my feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bless me, what ignorance! Because the soles of your feet have large pores
      through which to catch cold. Hasn't any one ever told you that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel smiled. &ldquo;That would be a queer arrangement for God to make, don't
      you think?&rdquo; she asked softly. &ldquo;Just as if He expected us to walk on our
      hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes's eyes widened, and an irrepressible &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; escaped from her
      lips. &ldquo;Has that young one reverence for anything in heaven above or earth
      beneath?&rdquo; she queried mentally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham managed to recover himself sufficiently to say, &ldquo;You
      shouldn't speak so, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know how it was about the tree of knowledge, grandpa,&rdquo; replied
      the child earnestly. &ldquo;God told Adam not to eat of it, because then he'd
      believe in good <i>and</i> evil, and that always makes such lots and <i>lots</i>
      of trouble. The Indians don't have to wear rubbers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drink your milk, Jewel,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham uncomfortably, not having
      the temerity to lift his eyes as high as his housekeeper's countenance.
      &ldquo;No matter about the Indians. You are a civilized little girl, and you
      must wear rubbers while you live with me. Mrs. Forbes will very kindly buy
      them for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have money,&rdquo; returned Jewel brightly. &ldquo;I have three dollars,&rdquo; she
      added, trying not to say it boastfully. &ldquo;Fifty cents for every week father
      and mother are going to be away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham wiped his mustache. &ldquo;You need not spend any of it for the
      rubbers,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;You are buying those to please me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall love to wear them to please you, grandpa,&rdquo; she returned
      affectionately. &ldquo;I'll put them on every time I can think of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only when it is wet, of course,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When it is rainy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;when it's rainy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Harry looked like my father, and she does, by Jove,&rdquo; mused Mr. Evringham.
      &ldquo;She's like me. Knows what she wants to eat, and cares for a horse, if she
      is a strange little being.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you like horses?&rdquo; he remarked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just love them,&rdquo; answered Jewel, &ldquo;and I came real close to them once.
      Father took me to the horse show.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he told mother he was going to blow me to it.&rdquo; The child laughed.
      &ldquo;Father's the greatest joker; he says the funniest things. He didn't blow
      me to it at all. He took me in the cable car, and we had more <i>fun</i>!
      It was the most be&mdash;eautiful place you ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. The music was playing, and there were coaches and four-in-hands and
      horns and men in red coats and beautiful little shiny carriages&mdash;and
      the horses! Oh, they all looked so proud and glad, and they trotted and
      ran and jumped over high fences, and the harness jingled and the people
      cheered!&rdquo; The child's cheeks were glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham gave an exclamation that was almost a laugh. &ldquo;You didn't
      sleep much that night, I'll wager!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't want to. I stayed awake a long time to realize that God
      doesn't love one of His children any better than another, so of course
      some time I'll wear a tall shiny hat and ride over fences just like
      flying. I'll have a horse,&rdquo; Jewel added slowly, looking off with a rapt
      expression as at a long-cherished vision, &ldquo;with a white star in his
      forehead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm! Very good taste,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham, scarcely knowing what he
      was saying, so dazed was he by the extraordinary mixture of ideas.
    </p>
    <p>
      After breakfast he had his usual interview with Mrs. Forbes concerning the
      important event of dinner. Jewel had run upstairs to dress Anna Belle.
    </p>
    <p>
      The menu decided upon, Mr. Evringham still lingered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes, I have never had any experience with little girls. You have,
      no doubt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Am I right in thinking that my granddaughter is&mdash;is
      a rather unusual specimen?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's older than Dick's hatband, sir,&rdquo; rejoined the housekeeper promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are they, perhaps, teaching differently in the schools from what they
      used to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know of, Mr. Evringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She uses very unusual expressions. I can't make it out. You are an
      intelligent woman, Mrs. Forbes. Did you ever happen to hear of such a
      thing as the&mdash;a&mdash;a&mdash;Scientific Statement of Being!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never in my life, sir,&rdquo; returned the housekeeper virtuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Extraordinary language that, from a&mdash;a child of her years. She seems
      to have been peculiarly brought up. You heard her reference to&mdash;in
      fact to&mdash;the Creator.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did, sir. At the breakfast table, too! I was as shocked as you were,
      sir. Her mother put a Bible into her trunk, but it's plain she never
      taught her any reverence. The Almighty give her a jumping horse indeed! If
      you'll excuse me, Mr. Evringham, I think you should have said something
      right there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker pulled his mustache. &ldquo;I've listened to more unreasonable views
      of heaven,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it was heaven she was talking about!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham shrugged his shoulders. &ldquo;You can't prove anything by me.
      She's the most extraordinary child I ever listened to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes pursed her lips. &ldquo;You'd not believe, sir, how differently she
      behaves when she is alone with me. As mild-mannered and quiet as you'd
      wish to see anywhere. She scarcely speaks a word.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham bit his lip and nodded. It gave him some amusement in the
      midst of his perplexity to remember the manner in which he had been
      advised to exorcise this tower of strength altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my opinion, sir, that children should be made to eat what is set
      before them,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Forbes, reverting to her principal grievance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would save you a lot of trouble if I had been trained that way&mdash;eh,
      Mrs. Forbes?&rdquo; returned the other, with extraordinary lightness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a very different thing, I should hope!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Forbes
      solemnly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, about fifty years different. Hard to teach an old dog new tricks,
      eh? You might have some chops for her luncheon, perhaps, and an extra one
      for her breakfast. She hasn't eaten anything this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the first time an order from Mr. Evringham evoked no reply from his
      housekeeper. He felt the weight of her disapproval. &ldquo;But get the overshoes
      by all means, as soon as convenient,&rdquo; he made haste to add. &ldquo;Ring for
      Zeke, if you please, Mrs. Forbes. I must be off.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER IX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A SHOPPING EXPEDITION
    </h3>
    <p>
      The housekeeper warned Jewel not to run out of doors that morning as she
      wished to accompany her to the shoe store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to take you, Anna Belle,&rdquo; Jewel said to her doll. &ldquo;I don't
      like to ask the giantess if I may, and of course, it won't be a very good
      time anyway, so you be patient and we'll go out together this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes's long widow's veil, a decoration she never had discarded hung
      low over her black gown as she stepped deliberately down the stairs from
      her barn chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going with the little girl, Zeke, to buy her a pair of rubbers,&rdquo; she
      announced to her son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going foot-back? Why don't you have out the 'broom'? One granddaughter's
      got as good a right to it as the other, hasn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should say so, but that child, Zeke, in addition to her wonderful
      boldness this morning with Mr. Evringham, that I told you about, is
      perfectly crazy over horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. That don't surprise me. A young one that can stand up to the
      governor wouldn't be afraid of anything in the way of horseflesh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I decided,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Forbes, pulling on her roomy black gloves,
      &ldquo;that it would be better for her to go this morning in the trolley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>did</i>? Well if that ain't a regular step-mother act!&rdquo; returned
      Zeke in protest. &ldquo;The kid had a bully time coming home from the depot
      yesterday. Dick felt good, and he just lit out. I tell you her eyes
      shone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like to do what's best for folks in the end,&rdquo; declared Mrs. Forbes
      virtuously. &ldquo;Julia's parents are poor, and likely to be. She's only going
      to be here six weeks, and what is the sense of encouraging a taste she
      can't ever indulge? No, I'll take her in the trolley. It's a nice morning,
      and I shan't mind the walk down to the gate.&rdquo; The speaker marched with the
      dignity which was always inseparable from the veil toward the back door of
      the house to give some last orders, and Zeke lounged out with his rake
      toward the grounds at the front. There he caught sight of a small figure
      in hat and jacket waiting on the piazza. He turned toward it, and Jewel
      advanced with a smile of recognition. She had had to look twice to
      identify her fine plum-colored companion of yesterday's drive with this
      youth in shirt sleeves and a soft old hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, little girl, how are you getting on?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pretty well, thank you.&rdquo; Her beaming expression left no doubt that she
      was very glad to see him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not particularly flattering if she is,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Fine ladies not out of
      their rooms yet, and ma doin' her duty by her to beat the band.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's your doll?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't bring her. I thought perhaps the&mdash;Mrs. Forbes would&mdash;would
      just as lief she didn't come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ma <i>hasn't</i> played with dolls for quite a spell,&rdquo; agreed Zeke, with
      a smile that was sunshine to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You live out in the barn with the horses, don't you?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
      &ldquo;Will you give me permission to go out there some time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sure. Come any time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes said I must ask permission,&rdquo; responded the child with an
      apprehensive glance behind her to see if her escort were arriving. &ldquo;What&mdash;what
      is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgotten this soon? I told you Zeke.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you did, but your mother said it was something very different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ezekiel, perhaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's it. I won't forget again. How many horses has grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two here, but I guess he's got more in the country. You come out to the
      barn any time you feel like it. You've heard of a bell cow, haven't you?
      Well, we've got the belle horse out there. She beats all creation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one I saw yesterday,&rdquo; eagerly, &ldquo;the one that runs away all the time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. This is Mr. Evringham's riding horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel hopped and clapped her hands. &ldquo;I'll see grandpa ride. Goody! I'll
      watch him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to your paths, Zeke,&rdquo; said a voice, and the veil appeared around the
      corner of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel quietly joined her stately companion, and walked away sedately
      beside her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They did not exchange many words on their way to the park gates, for Mrs.
      Forbes needed her breath for the rather long promenade, and Jewel was busy
      looking at the trees and trim swards and crocus beds beside the winding
      road.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside the gate they had to wait but a minute before the car came, and
      after they had boarded it, the little girl was entertained by looking out
      of the window, and often wished for Anna Belle's sympathy in some novel
      sight or sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      A ride of fifteen minutes brought them to the shoe store. Mrs. Forbes
      seemed to know the clerk, and Jewel was finally fitted to her guardian's
      satisfaction, but scarcely to her own, the housekeeper having selected the
      species known as storm rubbers, and chose them as large as would stay on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're quite warm, aren't they?&rdquo; said Jewel, looking down at her shiny
      feet and trying to speak cheerfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you wear them you want to be warm,&rdquo; was Mrs. Forbes's rejoinder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought my money,&rdquo; said the child, in a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Your grandfather wishes to make you a present of these.&rdquo; The
      housekeeper's tone was final, and she paid for the overshoes, which were
      wrapped up, and then she led Jewel out of the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next door was a candy shop with alluring windows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to go in here,&rdquo; said the little girl. &ldquo;Would you mind?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you spend your money for candy, Julia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm. Don't you like it?&rdquo; Jewel lingered, looking at the pretty display.
      Easter had recently passed, and there were bright-eyed little yellow
      chickens that especially took her fancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It isn't a question of liking it when people are poor,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Forbes. &ldquo;I'm astonished that your mother encourages you to spend money for
      candy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked up quickly. &ldquo;Did you think we were poor?&rdquo; she asked, with
      disconcerting suddenness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes hesitated. &ldquo;Your mother is a dressmaker, isn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she's just a splendid one. Everybody says so. We couldn't be poor,
      you know. She found out about God before I was old enough to talk, so you
      see all her poor time came before I can remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper glanced about her furtively. &ldquo;Julia, don't you know you
      shouldn't use your Creator's name on the street!&rdquo; she exclaimed, when she
      had made certain that no one was listening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;it isn't a proper place. Some one might hear you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, won't you let me get some candy now? If I knew what kind you liked,
      Mrs. Forbes, I'd get it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't eat candy as a rule. It's not only extravagant, it's very
      unhealthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl smiled. &ldquo;How do you suppose your stomach knows what you
      put into it?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I guess you're just a little&mdash;bit&mdash;afraid,
      aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Odder than Dick's hatband!&rdquo; quoth Mrs. Forbes again, mentally. &ldquo;I take
      horehound drops sometimes,&rdquo; she said aloud, &ldquo;for a cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can't you sneeze a little now?&rdquo; asked Jewel, amusement twinkling in her
      blue eyes. &ldquo;I do want so much to go in here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tempt Providence by making fun of sickness, Julia, or you'll live
      to regret it,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;I don't mind getting some horehound
      drops, but be careful now and don't spend too much. A little girl's money
      always burns in her pocket.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; returned the child dutifully, skipping up to the door of the shop
      and opening it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes followed slowly, and once inside, fell into conversation with
      the girl of whom she bought the cough candy. This gave Jewel opportunity
      to buy beside her caramels one of the lovely yellow chickens, which she
      designed for a special purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now don't you eat that candy before lunch. It will take away your
      appetite. It is nearly lunch time now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes as they left the
      store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And won't you either?&rdquo; asked the child, offering the open caramel bag
      with a spontaneous politeness which somehow made the housekeeper feel at a
      disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you. Stop that car, Julia, and make them wait for me,&rdquo; she
      said, making haste slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once within, it took Mrs. Forbes a minute or two to get her breath, but
      she soon noticed that her companion's eyes were fixed upon a man seated a
      little way from them across the car. A smile kept coming to the child's
      lips, and at last the gentleman himself recognized that he was an object
      of interest. He looked at the strange little girl kindly. Her hand went
      unconsciously to the small gold pin she wore. The man smiled and touched
      one of similar pattern which was fastening his tie. In a minute more his
      street was reached, and as he passed Jewel on his way out of the car, he
      stooped and gave her ready hand a little pressure.
    </p>
    <p>
      She colored with pleasure, and Mrs. Forbes swelled with curiosity and
      disapproval. She knew the man by sight as a highly respectable citizen.
      What was this wild Western child doing now? The car made too much noise to
      permit of investigation, so she waited until they had left it and entered
      the park gates.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia,&rdquo; she said then, &ldquo;where did you ever see that gentleman before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never did,&rdquo; replied the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean by such bold actions, then? What will he think of you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll think it's all right,&rdquo; returned Jewel. &ldquo;We have the same&mdash;the
      same friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper looked at her. It was beneath her dignity to ask further
      questions at present, but some time she meant to renew the subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very wrong for a little girl to take any notice of strangers,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; replied Jewel, &ldquo;but he was&mdash;different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes maintained silence henceforth until they reached home. &ldquo;You
      may hang your hat and jacket in the closet under the stairs whenever you
      don't wish to go to your room,&rdquo; she said when she parted with her
      companion at the piazza, &ldquo;but don't wander away anywhere before lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm. Thank you for taking me, Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're welcome,&rdquo; returned that lady, and the long black veil swept
      majestically toward the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sweet and rippling music was proceeding from the house. Jewel tiptoed
      across the piazza to a long window, from whence she could see the interior
      of the drawing-room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is the enchanted maiden,&rdquo; she said to herself, and sank down softly by
      the window, listening eagerly to the melodious strains and smooth runs
      which flowed from beneath the slender fingers. One piece followed another
      in quick succession, now gay, now grave, and the listener scarcely stirred
      in her enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, suddenly, in the midst of a Grieg melody, the player ceased, and
      crossing her arms upon the empty music rack, bowed her head upon them in
      such an attitude of abandon that Jewel's heart leaped in sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh cousin Eloise! What makes her so sorry?&rdquo; she thought. The child's
      intuition had been strong to perceive the nature of her aunt Madge. &ldquo;It
      must be such an awful thing to have your own mother an error fairy. That
      must be the reason. I wish I could tell her&rdquo;&mdash;Jewel jumped to her
      feet, but just as she was determining to go to her cousin, the soft-toned
      gong pealed its mellow summons, and she saw Eloise rise from the piano in
      time to meet her mother, who at that moment entered the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel went into the house, hung up her hat and jacket, and deposited her
      packages. By the time she reached the dining-room her aunt and cousin were
      already seated. Mrs. Evringham put up her lorgnette as she greeted the
      child. Eloise nodded a grave good-morning, and Mrs. Forbes began to serve
      the luncheon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked in vain for any trace of excitement or tears on her cousin's
      lovely face. Eloise did not address her or any one. Mrs. Evringham did the
      talking. After a question as to how Jewel had spent the morning, and
      without listening to the child's reply, she began to talk to her daughter
      of a drive she wished to take that afternoon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel discerned that Mrs. Forbes was not kindly disposed toward the mother
      and daughter, and that they ignored the housekeeper; that Eloise was
      languid and out of sympathy with her mother, and that Mrs. Evringham was
      impatient with her, often to the verge of sharpness. The child was glad
      when luncheon was over; but before going upstairs she brought her small
      bag of caramels and offered them to the ladies.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham gave a little laugh of surprise and looked at Eloise, who
      took one with a sober &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I could, child,&rdquo; said aunt Madge, glancing with amusement
      at the striped bag. &ldquo;Keep them for yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have some, won't you, Mrs. Forbes?&rdquo; asked Jewel, and the
      housekeeper so strongly disapproved of Mrs. Evringham's manner that she
      accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you would like to try some of our candy, Julia,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Evringham, as the child followed her aunt and cousin upstairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel paused while aunt Madge brought from her room into the hall a large
      box, beribboned and laced, full of a variety of confections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How pretty!&rdquo; exclaimed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is from your friend, Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; said her aunt. &ldquo;He sent it to the
      charming little girl, Eloise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel, running on up to her room eating the creamy chocolate, wondered
      still more why her cousin should seem so sorry, with so much to make her
      happy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Anna Belle, the time has really come,&rdquo; she said happily to her doll,
      as she took her in her arms and began putting on her jacket and hat.
      &ldquo;We're going away from Castle Discord to seek our fortunes. We're going to
      leave the giantess, and leave the impolite error fairy, and leave the poor
      enchanted maiden, and go to find the ravine and the brook. Wait till I put
      on my oldest shoes, for we shall have to climb deep, deep down to get near
      to father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At last she was ready, and when she had closed the heavy house door behind
      her, and had run down the driveway to the park road, a delicious sense of
      freedom possessed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There goes the little Westerner,&rdquo; observed Mrs. Evringham, looking from
      her window. &ldquo;It's a good thing she knows how to amuse herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A good thing, indeed,&rdquo; returned Eloise. &ldquo;There is no one here to do
      anything for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has wonderful assurance for such a plain little monkey,&rdquo; went on Mrs.
      Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has extremely good breeding,&rdquo; returned her daughter, coming to the
      window and following Jewel's retreating figure with her eyes, &ldquo;and a
      charming face when she smiles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Look out for yourself, then. I thought last night, once or
      twice, at dinner, that she was rather entertaining to her grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has her doll,&rdquo; said Eloise wistfully. &ldquo;Where can she be going? I wish
      I were going with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham laughed. &ldquo;Well, you <i>are</i> bored. Pshaw, my dear! Lie
      down and get a little beauty sleep. Then we will go driving and see that
      charming spot Dr. Ballard told us about. I'm sure he will call to-night.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER X
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RAVINE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Outside the well-kept roads of Bel-Air Park, Nature had been encouraged to
      work her sweet will. The drive wound along the edge of a picturesque
      gorge, and it was not long before Jewel found the scene of her father's
      favorite stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sides of the ravine were studded with tall trees, and in its depths
      flowed a brook, unusually full now from the spring rains.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child lost no time in creeping beneath the slender wire fence at the
      roadside, and scrambling down the incline. The brook whispered and
      gurgled, wild flowers sprang amid the ferns in the shelter and moisture.
      The child was enraptured.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Anna Belle!&rdquo; She exclaimed, hugging the doll for pure joy. &ldquo;Castle
      Discord is far away. There's nobody down here but God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For hours she played happily in the enchanting spot, all unconscious of
      time. Anna Belle lay on a bed of moss, while Jewel became acquainted with
      her wonderful new playmate, the brook. The only body of water with which
      she had been familiar hitherto was Lake Michigan. Now she drew stones out
      of the bank and made dams and waterfalls. She sailed boats of chips and
      watched them shoot the tiny rapids. She lay down on the bank beside Anna
      Belle and gazed up through the leafy treetops. Many times this programme
      had been varied, when at last equipages began to pass on the road above.
      She could see twinkling wheels and smart liveries.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a start of recollection, she considered that she might have been a
      long time in the ravine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish somebody would let me bring a watch the next time,&rdquo; she said to
      her doll, as she took her up. &ldquo;Haven't we had a beautiful afternoon, Anna
      Belle? Let's call it the Ravine of Happiness, and we'll come here every
      day&mdash;just every day; but perhaps it's time for grandpa to be home,
      dearie, so we must go back to the castle.&rdquo; She sighed unconsciously as she
      began climbing up the steep bank and crept under the wire. &ldquo;I hope we
      haven't stayed very long, because the giantess might not like it,&rdquo; she
      continued uneasily; but as she set her feet in the homeward road, every
      sensation of anxiety fled before an approaching vision. She saw a handsome
      man in riding dress mounted on a shining horse with arched neck, that
      lifted its feet daintily as it pranced along the tree-lined avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; ejaculated Jewel, stepping to the roadside and pausing, her
      hands clasped beneath her chin and her eyes shining with admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham drew rein, not displeased by the encounter. The child
      apparently could not speak. She eyed the horse rather than its rider, a
      fact which the latter observed and enjoyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remind you of the horse show?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> the horse show,&rdquo; rejoined the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Essex Maid, Jewel,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham. He patted the mare's
      shining neck. &ldquo;You shall go out to the barn with me some time and visit
      her.&rdquo; His eyes wandered over the ruffled hair, the hat on the back of the
      child's head, and the wet spots on her dress. &ldquo;Run home now,&rdquo; he added. &ldquo;I
      heard Mrs. Forbes asking for you as I came out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rode on, and Jewel, her face radiant, followed him with her eyes. In a
      minute he turned, and she threw rapid kisses after him. He raised his hat,
      and then a curve in the road hid him from view.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel sighed rapturously and hurried along the road. The giantess had
      asked for her. Ah, what a happy world it would be if there were nothing at
      Bel-Air Park but grandpa, his horses, and the ravine!
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes espied the child in the distance, and was at the door when she
      came in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After this, Julia, you must never go away without telling me where&rdquo;&mdash;she
      began, when her eyes recognized the condition of the gingham frock, and
      the child's feet. &ldquo;Look at how you've drabbled your dress!&rdquo; she
      ejaculated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's clean water,&rdquo; returned Julia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But your feet! Why, Julia Evringham, they are as wet as sop! Where have
      you been?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Playing by the brook in the ravine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes groaned. &ldquo;Nothing will satisfy a child but finding the place
      where they can get the dirtiest and make the most trouble. Why didn't you
      wear your rubbers, you naughty girl?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;it wasn't raining.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Raining! Those rubbers are to keep your feet dry. Haven't you got any
      sense?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked a little pale. &ldquo;I didn't know I should get wet in the brook,&rdquo;
       she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, go right upstairs now, up the backstairs, and take off every one of
      those wet things. Let me feel your petticoat. Yes, that's wet, too. You
      undress and get into a hot bath, and then you put on your nightgown and go
      right to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go to bed!&rdquo; echoed the child, bewildered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, to bed. You won't come down to dinner. Perhaps that will teach you
      to wear your rubbers next time and be more careful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel found the backstairs and ascended them, her little heart hot within
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the impolitest woman in the whole world, Anna Belle!&rdquo; she
      whispered. &ldquo;I'm going to not cry. Mother didn't know what impoliteness
      there was at grandpa's or she wouldn't have let us come.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's eyes were bright as she found her room and began undressing.
      &ldquo;But you mustn't be angry, dearie,&rdquo; she continued excitedly to her doll.
      &ldquo;It's the worst error to be angry, because it means hating. You treat me,
      Anna Belle, and I'll treat you,&rdquo; she went on, unfastening her clothes with
      unsteady hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      With many a pause to work at a refractory elastic or button, and many
      interruptions from catches in her breath, she murmured aloud during the
      process of her undressing: &ldquo;Dear Father in Heaven, I seem to feel sorry
      all over, and full of error. Help me to know that I'm not a mortal mind
      little girl, hating and angry, but I am Thy child, and the only things I
      know are good, happy things. Error has no power and Love has all power. I
      love Mrs. Forbes, and she loves me. Thou art here even in this house, and
      please help me to know that one of Thy children cannot hurt another.&rdquo; Here
      Jewel slipped into the new wrapper her mother had made, and hurried into
      the white tiled bathroom near by. While she let the water run into the tub
      she put her hand into her pocket mechanically, in search of a
      handkerchief, and when she felt the crisp touch of paper she drew it out
      eagerly. It was covered, and she read the words written in her mother's
      distinct hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love to my Jewel. Is she making a stepping-stone of every trial, and
      learning to think less and less about herself, and more and more about
      other people? And does she remember that little girls cannot always
      understand the error that grown-up people have to meet, especially those
      who have not Science to help them? They must be treated very gently, and I
      hope my little Jewel will be always kind and patient, and make her new
      friends glad she is there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child folded the paper and put it carefully back in her pocket. Then
      she took her bath, and returning to her room undressed her doll in
      silence. Finally, changing her wrapper for her nightdress, she climbed
      into bed, where she lay thinking and looking at the sunlight on the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      At dinner time the maid Sarah appeared with a tray. &ldquo;Here's your dinner,
      Miss Julia,&rdquo; she said, looking at the heavy-eyed little girl. &ldquo;It's too
      bad you're not well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am well, thank you,&rdquo; replied Jewel. &ldquo;I'm sorry you had to carry that
      heavy tray up so many stairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't mind that,&rdquo; returned the girl good-naturedly. &ldquo;I'll set it
      right here by the bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is grandpa down there?&rdquo; asked Jewel wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Miss Julia. They're all eating their dinner. I hope you'll enjoy
      yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah went away, and the little girl spread some bread and butter and ate
      it slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, when the family had gathered at the dinner table, Mr. Evringham
      looked up at his housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is Jewel?&rdquo; he asked shortly. &ldquo;I object to her being unpunctual.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. She is having dinner in her room. She was very naughty and got
      wet in the brook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, indeed!&rdquo; Mr. Evringham frowned and looked down. He had been a little
      disappointed that the bright face was not watching to see him come home
      from his ride, but of course discipline must be maintained. &ldquo;I'm sorry to
      hear this,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham and Eloise found him a shade less taciturn than usual
      to-night. He felt vaguely that he now had an ally of his own flesh and
      blood in the house, a spirit sufficiently kindred to prefer his society to
      theirs, and this made him unusually lenient.
    </p>
    <p>
      He meant to go upstairs after dinner, and warn Jewel to be more careful in
      future to conform to all Mrs. Forbes's rules; but the meal was scarcely
      over when a friend called to get him to attend some business meeting held
      that evening in the interests of the town, and he became interested in his
      statements and went away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wasn't father quite agreeable this evening?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Evringham of
      Eloise. &ldquo;What did I tell you? I could see that he felt relief because that
      plain little creature was not in evidence. Father always was so
      fastidious. Of course it is selfish in a way, but it is no use to blame
      men for caring for beauty. They will do it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a shame to make that little girl stay upstairs,&rdquo; returned Eloise.
      &ldquo;I judge she managed to amuse herself this afternoon, and so she gets
      punished for it. I should like to go up and sit with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would not be worth while,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham quickly. &ldquo;I'm sure
      Dr. Ballard will be here soon. You would have to come right down again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is not the reason I don't go,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;It is because I
      am not an Evringham, and I have determined not to arrive at friendly
      relations with any one of the name. When I once escape from here, they
      will have seen the last of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The way of escape lies open,&rdquo; returned her mother soothingly. &ldquo;I'm glad
      you have on that gown. If a man cares for a woman, he always loves to see
      her in white.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as dinner was over, Mrs. Forbes ascended the stairs to see her
      prisoner. Jewel was lying quietly in bed, the tray, apparently untouched,
      beside her. The latter circumstance Mrs. Forbes observed at once.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why haven't you eaten your dinner, Julia?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I hope you are not
      sulking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm. I don't believe I am. I don't know what that means.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what sulky means?&rdquo; suspiciously. &ldquo;It is very naughty for a
      little girl to refuse to eat her dinner because she is angry at being
      punished for her own good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you send me to bed because you loved me?&rdquo; asked Jewel. Her cheeks
      were very red, but even the disconcerted housekeeper could see that she
      was not excited or angry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody loves good little girls,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;Now eat your
      dinner, Julia, so I can carry down the tray.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I did eat the bread. It was all I wanted. It was very nice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The polite addition made the housekeeper uncertain. While she paused Jewel
      added, &ldquo;I wish I could see grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's gone out on business. He won't be back until after you are asleep.
      And if you were thinking of complaining to him, Julia, I tell you it won't
      do any good. He will trust everything to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I would trouble grandpa?&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper looked at her in silent perplexity. The blue eyes were
      direct and innocent, but there was a heaviness about them that stirred
      Mrs. Forbes uncomfortably.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must have got too tired playing this afternoon, Julia,&rdquo; she said
      decisively, &ldquo;or you would be hungry for your dinner. You took that hot
      bath I told you to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you put your wet things? Oh, I see, you've spread them out
      very nicely; but those shoes&mdash;I shall have to have them cleaned and
      polished for you. Now go to sleep as quick as you can and have a long
      night's rest. I'm sure the next time you go out you won't be so careless.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eyes followed the speaker as she bustled about and at last took up
      the tray.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you kiss me good-night, Mrs. Forbes?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The surprised housekeeper set down her burden, stooped over the bed and
      kissed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There now, I see you're sorry,&rdquo; she said, somewhat touched.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gave her a little smile. &ldquo;No'm, I've stopped being sorry,&rdquo; she
      replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd puzzle a Philadelphia lawyer,&rdquo; soliloquized the housekeeper as she
      descended the stairs with the tray. &ldquo;I suppose her mother is uneducated
      and uses queer English. As the old ones croak, the young ones learn. The
      child uses words nobody ever heard of, and is ignorant of the commonest
      ones. I'm glad she's so fond of me if I've got to take care of her.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      DR. BALLARD
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham looked about, half in apprehension, half in anticipation, as
      he entered the dining-room the following morning. Jewel had not arrived,
      so he settled himself to read his paper. Each time there was a sound he
      glanced up, bracing himself for the approach of light feet, beaming face,
      and an ardent embrace. His interest in the news gradually lessened, and
      his expectancy increased. She did not come. At last he began to suspect
      that the unprecedented had happened, and that Mrs. Forbes herself was
      late.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at his watch with suddenly rising amazement. It was ten minutes
      past the appointed time. He began feeling around with his foot for the
      electric bell. It was an unaccustomed movement, for his wishes were
      usually anticipated. By the time he found it, he had become a seriously
      injured man, and the peal he rang summoned Sarah suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bring me my coffee at once, if you please. What is the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The maid did not know. He was drinking his first cup when the housekeeper
      entered the room, flushed of countenance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll have to excuse me, Mr. Evringham. I couldn't come a minute sooner.
      Julia is sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sick! I should like to know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, she got sopping wet in that brook yesterday, and here, just as I
      knew it would be, she's got a fever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A fever, eh?&rdquo; repeated Mr. Evringham in a startled tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir, and what's more, when I told her you would send for the doctor,
      it was worse than about the rubbers. She talked all the rubbish you can
      think of. I'm sure she's flighty&mdash;said she never had a doctor, that
      she always got well, and even cried when I told her that that was
      nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was she ill all night, do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. I found her trying to get up when I went to her room, and I
      saw at once that she wasn't able to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Mrs. Forbes, all I can do is to ask your pardon for adding so much
      to your cares. Let Sarah bring me my eggs, and then, if you please,
      telephone for Dr. Ballard to come over before his office hour.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, sir, but I'll ask you to see the child before you go to town and
      make her promise to behave about the doctor. You'd have thought I was
      asking to let in a roaring lion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shy, probably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shy! That child shy!&rdquo; thought Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; continued the broker, &ldquo;and if you had thought to
      mention him, she wouldn't have made any fuss.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you'll excuse me differing with you, Mr. Evringham, I don't think that
      child's got a shy bone in her body. In the trolley car yesterday, didn't
      she make up to a perfect stranger! She eyed him and fingered that little
      gold pin she wears, till he smiled and touched one of the same pattern in
      his own cravat. Young as she is, she's some kind of a free mason or secret
      society, you may be sure. I actually saw him take her hand and give her
      the grip as he got out of the car. Why you know who it is, it was Mr.
      Reeves of Highland Street.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. You are imaginative, Mrs. Forbes. Mr. Reeves is fond of children,
      and Jewel has a friendly way of looking at people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper bridled. &ldquo;Well, all is, I guess, you'll find I ain't
      imaginative when you come to talk with her about the doctor,&rdquo; was the firm
      response. &ldquo;When I said medicine she looked as scared as if I'd said
      poison.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. Been dosed then. Mother an allopath probably. Burnt child dreads the
      fire. I think homeopathy is the thing for children. Guy will do very well.
      Call him up at once, please. He might go out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Evringham had finished his breakfast, he climbed to the white
      room, planning as he went a short and peremptory speech to the rebellious
      one; for he had less time left than usual for his daily talk with his
      housekeeper before catching the train.
    </p>
    <p>
      The curtains in the room were half drawn as he entered, and the child's
      figure looked small in the big white bed. She exclaimed as he drew near,
      and seizing his hand, kissed it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better not kiss me, grandpa, because I'm so hot and uncomfortable,&rdquo;
       she said thickly. &ldquo;Oh, how I wanted to see you all night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little hands clinging to his were burning. He sat down on the edge of
      the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sorry for this, Jewel. It's your own fault, I understand, my
      girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know it is. When I first called the house Castle Discord and
      talked to Anna Belle about the error fairy, and the enchanted maiden, and
      the giantess, I didn't see it was hate creeping in and making me not
      careful to deny it all. I know it is all my fault.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham gazed at the flushed face with startled eyes. &ldquo;Dear me, this
      is really very bad!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Delirious so early in the morning. I
      wish Guy would come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll soon have Dr. Ballard here,&rdquo; he said aloud, trying to speak
      soothingly. &ldquo;He'll set you all right very soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, grandpa, dear grandpa,&rdquo; with the utmost earnestness, &ldquo;would you
      please not send for the doctor? I won't be any trouble. I don't want
      anything to eat, only a drink of water, and I'll soon be well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her beseeching tone and her helplessness touched some unsuspected chord in
      her listener's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel, don't you want to go out to the stable with me and feed Essex Maid
      with sugar?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, grandpa,&rdquo; with a half sob.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want me to be unhappy and worried about you when I get into my
      office?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you liked Dr. Ballard, I'm sure, when you came out with him on the
      train day before yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Day before yesterday! Oh, <i>was</i> it? It seems a year ago! But I
      wanted to come and see you so much I was willing to let father and mother
      go away, and I never thought that I wouldn't know when error was getting
      hold of me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, never mind now, Jewel. Dr. Ballard will help you, and as soon as
      you get well I'll take you for a fine long drive, if you'll be good. I'm
      sure you don't want to trouble me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Another half sob caught the child's throat. &ldquo;Here is something I
      bought for you yesterday, grandpa.&rdquo; She drew from under the further pillow
      the yellow chicken, somewhat disheveled, and put it in his hand. &ldquo;I meant
      to give it to you last night, but Mrs. Forbes kept me upstairs because she
      thought she ought to make me sorry, and so I couldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The stockbroker cleared his throat as he regarded his new possession. &ldquo;It
      was kind of you, Jewel,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I shall stand it on my desk. Now&mdash;ahem&rdquo;&mdash;looking
      around the big empty room, &ldquo;you won't be lonely, I hope, until the doctor
      comes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'd like to be alone, I have so much work to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, dear me!&rdquo; thought Mr. Evringham, &ldquo;this is very distressing. She
      seems to have lucid intervals, and then so quickly gets flighty again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides, I like to think of the Ravine of Happiness,&rdquo; continued the
      child, &ldquo;and the brook. Supposing I could lay my cheek down in the brook
      now. The water is so cool, and it laughs and whispers such pretty things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now if you would try to go to sleep, Jewel,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham, &ldquo;it
      would please me very much. Good-by. I shall come to see you again
      to-night.&rdquo; He stooped his tall form and kissed the child's forehead, and
      her hot lips pressed his hand, then he went out.
    </p>
    <p>
      At the foot of the stairs he encountered Mrs. Forbes waiting, and hastily
      put behind him the hand that held the chicken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's very badly off, very badly off, I'm afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope not, sir. Children are always flighty if they have a little fever.
      What about dinner, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have anything you please,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham briefly. &ldquo;I wish to see
      Dr. Ballard as soon as he arrives. Tell Zeke I shall not go until the next
      train.&rdquo; With these words the broker entered his study, and his housekeeper
      looked after him in amazement. It was the first time she had ever seen him
      indifferent concerning his dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if he thinks she's got something catching,&rdquo; she soliloquized.
      Then a sudden thought occurred to her. &ldquo;No great loss without some small
      gain,&rdquo; she thought grimly. &ldquo;'T would clear the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She watched at the window until she saw Dr. Ballard's buggy approaching.
      Then she opened the door and met him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your little visitor do you say?&rdquo; asked the young doctor as he greeted her
      and entered. &ldquo;What mischief has she been up to so soon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the usual sort,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes, and recounted her grievances.
      &ldquo;She's the oddest child in the world,&rdquo; she finished, &ldquo;and her last freak
      is that she doesn't want to have a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, what heresy!&rdquo; The young man smiled. &ldquo;Which room, Mrs. Forbes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please go into the library first, Dr. Ballard. Mr. Evringham is waiting
      to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker was sitting before his desk as the doctor entered, and he
      turned with a brief greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad you've come, Ballard. I'm very much troubled about the child.
      Her father and mother abroad you understand, and I feel the
      responsibility. She seems very flighty, quite wild in her talk at moments.
      I wished to warn you that one of her feverish ideas is that she doesn't
      want a doctor. You will have to use some tact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The physician's face lost its careless smile. &ldquo;Delirious, you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go right up, Guy. I'll wait for you here. It's so sudden. She was
      quite well, to all appearances, yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Children are sensitive little mortals,&rdquo; remarked Dr. Ballard, and then
      Mrs. Forbes ushered him up to the white room. He asked her to remain
      within call, and entered alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child's eyes were open as he approached the bed, the black case she
      remembered in his hand. By her expression he saw that her mind was clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, well, Jewel, this isn't the way I meant you to receive me the first
      time I called,&rdquo; he said pleasantly, drawing up a chair beside the bed. The
      child put out her hand to his offered one and tried to smile. As he held
      the hand he felt her pulse. &ldquo;This isn't the way to behave when you go
      visiting,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it isn't,&rdquo; returned Jewel contritely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next time you go wading in the brook, take off your shoes and
      stockings, little one, and I think you would better wait until later in
      the season, anyway. You've made quick work of this business.&rdquo; As he talked
      the doctor took his little thermometer out of its case. &ldquo;Now then, let me
      slip this under your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; asked Jewel, shrinking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! Haven't you ever had your temperature tried? Well, you have been a
      healthy little girl! All the better. Just take it under your tongue, and
      don't speak for a minute, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't ask me to. I can't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's nothing to be afraid of. It won't hurt you.&rdquo; The doctor smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what that is now,&rdquo; said Jewell, regarding the little tube. &ldquo;A man
      was cured of paralysis once by having a thing like that stuck in his
      mouth. He thought it was meant to cure him. I haven't paralysis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor began to consider that perhaps Mr. Evringham had not
      exaggerated. &ldquo;Come, Jewel,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;I thought we were such good
      friends. You are wasting my time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A moment more of hesitation, and then the child suddenly opened her mouth
      and accepted the thermometer. She kept her eyes closed during the process
      of waiting, and at last Dr. Ballard took out the little instrument and
      examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me see your tongue.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child stared in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put out your tongue, Jewel,&rdquo; he repeated kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But that is impolite,&rdquo; she protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      He changed his position. The poor little thing was flighty, and no wonder,
      with such a temperature. He took her hand again. &ldquo;I'll overlook the
      impoliteness. Run out your tongue now. Far as you can, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child obeyed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she said, &ldquo;I feel very uncomfortable, Dr. Ballard. I don't feel
      a bit like visiting, so if you wouldn't <i>mind</i> going away until I
      feel better. You interrupted me when you came in. I have lots of work to
      do yet. When I get well I'd just love to see you. I'd rather see you than
      almost anybody in Bel-Air.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, dear. I'll go away very soon. Where does your throat feel sore?
      Put your finger on the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked up with all the rebuke she could convey. &ldquo;You ought not to
      ask me that,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard rose and went to the door. &ldquo;Get me a glass of water, please,
      Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a glass. I want a whole pitcher full right side of me,&rdquo; said Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, a pitcher full also, if you please, Mrs. Forbes. Just let the maid
      bring them up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor returned to the bedside. &ldquo;Now we'll soon forget that you wet
      those little feet,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That didn't do me any harm, that clean sweet brook. Mrs. Forbes didn't
      know what was the real matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My own fault,&rdquo; said Jewel, speaking with feverish quickness and squeezing
      the doctor's hand. &ldquo;When I came here I found that nobody loved one another
      and everybody was afraid and sorry, and instead of denying it and helping
      them, I began voicing error and calling them names. I didn't keep
      remembering that God was here, and I called it Castle Discord and called
      Mrs. Forbes the giantess, and aunt Madge the error fairy, and cousin
      Eloise the enchanted maiden, and of course how could I help getting sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard leaned toward her. Was this an impromptu tale, or was it a
      fact that this child had been coldly treated and unhappy? &ldquo;You have a
      sensitive conscience, Jewel,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Here Sarah entered, set down the tray with pitcher, glasses, and spoon,
      and departed. The doctor loosed the little hand he had been holding, took
      up his case, and opened it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel watched him with apprehension. &ldquo;That's&mdash;medicine isn't it?&rdquo; she
      asked with bated breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; The doctor carefully selected a bottle of liquid and set it on the
      table. &ldquo;I think this one will do us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's remark on the train about materia medica recurred to him, and he
      smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Ballard, aren't you a Christian?&rdquo; she asked suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced up. &ldquo;I hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll forgive me if I won't take medicine. I put out my tongue, and
      I sucked the little glass thing because I didn't want to trouble you; but
      I have too much faith in God to take medicine.&rdquo; The child looked at the
      doctor appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He began to see light, and in his surprise, for a moment he did not reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jesus Christ would have used drugs if they had been right,&rdquo; she added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But He isn't here now,&rdquo; returned the astonished young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; in gentle reproach, &ldquo;Christ is the Truth of God. Isn't
      He here now, healing us and helping us just the same as ever? Didn't He
      say He would be? You will see how much better I shall be to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard met the heavy eyes with his own kind, clear ones. &ldquo;I see you
      have been taught in new ways, Jewel,&rdquo; he said seriously, &ldquo;but you are only
      a little girl, and while you are in your grandfather's house you ought to
      do as he wishes. He wishes you to let me prescribe for you. No one who is
      ill can help making trouble. You have no right not to try to get well in
      the way Mr. Evringham and Mrs. Forbes wish you to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel felt herself in a desperate position. The corners of her lips
      twitched down. Dr. Ballard thought he saw his advantage, and leaned his
      fine head toward her. She impulsively threw her arms around his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want to hurt my feelings, Jewel,&rdquo; he said. She was crying
      softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;it would make me&mdash;very&mdash;sorry, but it would be&mdash;worse&mdash;to
      hurt&mdash;God's. Please don't make me, please, please don't make me, Dr.
      Ballard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was increasingly excited, and he feared the effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well then, Jewel,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;I don't want to do you more harm
      than good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you!&rdquo; she exclaimed fervently, through her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But Mrs. Forbes must think you have the medicine. You haven't told her
      that you are&mdash;ahem&mdash;a Christian Scientist. I suppose that is
      what you call yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir. A Christian Scientist. Oh, you're the kindest man,&rdquo; pursued the
      relieved child. &ldquo;I realized in my prayer that you didn't know it was wrong
      to believe in material medica, for you reflect love all the time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While she was talking and wiping her eyes the doctor took the pitcher and
      one of the glasses to the window, and stood with his back to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; he said, returning, &ldquo;we'll put this half glass of water on the
      table. I put the spoon across it so, and when Mrs. Forbes is next in the
      room you take a couple of spoonfuls and that will satisfy her. You may
      tell her that I wanted you only to take it about four times during the
      day. If you are better when I come back this evening, I will not insist
      upon your taking any pellets on your tongue. Here is the other glass for
      you to drink from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a few more kind words Dr. Ballard took his departure, and going
      downstairs met Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;The little girl has a heavy feverish cold.
      She understands how to take her medicine. She will probably sleep a good
      deal. Let her be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went on to the study, where Mr. Evringham was waiting, sitting at the
      desk, his head on his hand, frowning at the yellow chicken. He looked up
      expectantly as the doctor entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard came forward and seated himself in a neighboring chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know what you have upstairs there?&rdquo; he asked in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For heaven's sake, Guy, don't tell me it's something serious&mdash;something
      infectious!&rdquo; Mr. Evringham turned pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's sudden smile was reassuring. &ldquo;It does seem to be infectious
      to some degree,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;but I don't believe you'll catch it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you grinning at, boy?&rdquo; asked the broker sharply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be alarmed, Mr. Evringham, but the fact is, that you have in your
      house a small and young but perfectly formed and well-developed specimen
      of a Christian Scientist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, man!&rdquo; The broker grew red again.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard nodded deliberately. &ldquo;Your little granddaughter belongs to the
      new cult; and I can assure you she is dyed in the wool, and moreover is
      all wool and a yard wide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The devil you say!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;But,&rdquo; he added with a
      sudden thought, &ldquo;that may be a part of the poor child's feverish nonsense.
      She was full of talk of castles and giantesses and fairies and what not
      when I was up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. She is no flightier than you are this minute. All these titles are
      those she has given to your house and household in the last two days, and
      according to her diagnosis, it is that indulgence from which she is
      suffering now, and not from too much brook. She says she has 'voiced
      error.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor looked quizzically at his friend, who returned his gaze,
      nonplussed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it&mdash;'error,'&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Evringham, &ldquo;that's what she is
      often saying. This explains her vocabulary, in all probability. She has
      sometimes the strangest talk you ever listened to. Well, that's the
      mother's doing, of course, and not the child's fault. I maintain it is not
      the child's fault. With it all, Ballard, I tell you she's a very well
      meaning child&mdash;a rather winning child, in fact. Good natured
      disposition. I hope she's not very ill. I do, indeed. Ha! That, then, is
      why she was so excited at the thought of having a doctor. Tomfoolery!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that was it. We've had some argument.&rdquo; The young doctor smiled. &ldquo;She
      doesn't consider me hopeless, however. She told me that she had mentioned
      to the Lord that she was sure I didn't know it was wrong to believe in
      materia medica.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No one for years had heard Mr. Evringham laugh as he laughed at this. The
      doctor joined him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not surprised,&rdquo; said the broker at last. &ldquo;If there is anything she
      does not mention to her Creator, I have yet to learn what it is. How did
      you get around her, Ballard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I used a little justifiable hocus-pocus about the medicine. That's
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think it's not anything very serious, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think not. Where there's so much temperature it is a little hard to
      tell at first with a child. This evening I shall make a more thorough
      examination. The ice is broken now, and it will be easier. She will be
      less excited. I see,&rdquo; glancing at the yellow chicken, whose beady eyes
      appeared to be following the conversation, &ldquo;the little girl has found her
      way even into this sanctum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham cleared his throat as he followed the doctor's glance. &ldquo;No,&rdquo;
       he responded shortly. &ldquo;She has not found her way in here yet. That is&mdash;my
      chicken. She bought it for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard lifted his eyebrows and smiled as he arose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come back before dinner if possible, Ballard. I shall be uneasy.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE TELEGRAM
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes entered Jewel's room after speaking with the doctor. The
      little girl looked at her eagerly. A plan had formed in her mind which
      depended for its success largely on the housekeeper's complaisance, and
      she wished to propitiate her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to fix it so you can call me when you need anything, Julia,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;The doctor has told you about taking the medicine, and here is a
      little clock I'm going to put on your table right by the bed, and I've
      brought up a bell. I shall leave the farther door open so the sound of
      this bell will go right down the backstairs, and one of us will come up
      whenever you ring. Dr. Ballard says it's best for you to be quiet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm,&rdquo; replied Jewel. &ldquo;Do you think, Mrs. Forbes&mdash;would it be too
      much trouble&mdash;would he have time&mdash;could I see Jeremiah just a
      few minutes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See who?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeremiah&mdash;the gentleman who lives with the horses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean my son Ezekiel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes'm. Ezekiel. I knew it was a prophet. He always speaks very kindly
      to me, and I like him. I wish I could see him just a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes was very much astonished and somewhat flattered. &ldquo;It's
      wonderful, the fancy that child has taken to me and mine,&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, folks must be humored when they're sick,&rdquo; she replied. &ldquo;Let me
      see,&rdquo; looking at the little clock, &ldquo;yes, Mr. Evringham's missed the second
      train. There'll be five or ten minutes yet, and 'Zekiel's got to wait
      anyway. I guess he can come up and see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mrs. Forbes!&rdquo; returned Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper made her way out to the barn, where her son in his livery
      was waiting and reading the paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The doctor's gone, Zeke, and the child wants to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me?&rdquo; returned the coachman in surprise. &ldquo;Why the bully little kid!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, come and be quick. There won't be much time. You watch the clock
      that's side of her bed, and don't you be late.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      'Zekiel followed with alacrity. His mother, starting him up the
      backstairs, gave him directions how to go, and remained below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel, her eyes fixed on the open back door of her room, felt a leap of
      the heart as Zeke, fine in his handsome livery, came blushing and
      tiptoeing into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm so glad, I'm so glad!&rdquo; she exclaimed in her soft, thick voice. &ldquo;Shut
      the door, please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you to remember you'd only got to say 'Zeke' and I'd come,&rdquo; he
      said, approaching the bed. &ldquo;I'm awful sorry you're sick, little kid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you ever hear of Christian Science, Zeke?&rdquo; she asked hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did. Woman I knew in Boston cured of half a dozen things. She held
      that Christian Science did it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, good, good. I'm a Christian Scientist, and nobody here is, and I want
      to send a telegram to Chicago, to a lady to treat me. Nobody would do it
      for me but you. <i>Will</i> you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It would have taken a hard heart to resist the appeal, and Zeke's was
      soft.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I will,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Going right to the station now to take
      Mr. Evringham. I can send it as well as not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get some paper, Zeke, in the top bureau drawer. There's a pencil on the
      bureau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He obeyed, and she gave him an address which he wrote down. &ldquo;Now this:
      'Please treat me for fever and sore throat. Jewel.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke wrote the message and tucked it into a pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now please get my leather bag in the drawer,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;and take
      out money enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow hesitated. &ldquo;If you haven't got plenty of money&rdquo;&mdash;he
      began.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have. You'll see. Oh, Zeke, you've made me so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coachman's clumsy hands fumbled with the clasp of the little bag.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can do it,&rdquo; said Jewel, and he brought it to her and watched her while
      she took out the money and gave it to him. He took a coin, returned the
      rest to the bag, and snapped it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, little girl,&rdquo; he said uneasily, &ldquo;you look to me like a doctor'd do
      you a whole lot o' good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gazed at him in patient wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who made the doctor?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeke stood on one foot and then on the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God did, and you know it, Zeke. He's the one to go to in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you're going to that Chicago woman,&rdquo; objected Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, because she'll go to God for me. I'm being held down by something
      that pretends to have power, and though I know it's an old cheat, I
      haven't understanding enough to get rid of it as quickly as she will. You
      see, I wouldn't have been taken sick if I hadn't believed in a lie instead
      of denying it. We have to watch our thoughts every minute, and I tell you,
      Zeke, sometimes it seems real hard work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Should say so,&rdquo; returned 'Zekiel. &ldquo;The less you think the better, I
      should suppose, if that's the case. I've got to be going now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you'll send the telegram <i>surely</i>, and you won't speak of it to
      any one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mum's the word, and I'll send it if it's the last act; but don't put all
      your eggs in one basket, little kid. I know Dr. Ballard's been here, and
      now you do everything he said, like a good girl, and between the two of
      'em they ought to fix you up. I'd pin more faith to a doctor in the hand
      than to one in the bush a thousand miles away, if 't was <i>me</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel smiled on him from heavy eyes. &ldquo;Did you ever hear of God's needing
      any help?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I'll never forget your being so kind to me, never,
      Zeke; and when error melts away I'm coming out to the stable with grandpa.
      He said I should. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the plum-colored livery had disappeared Jewel drew herself up,
      took the water pitcher between her hot little hands, and drank long and
      deeply. Then with a sigh of satisfaction she turned over in bed and drew
      Anna Belle close to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just see, dearie,&rdquo; she murmured, &ldquo;how we are always taken care of!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham saw Dr. Ballard's buggy drive away and lost no time in
      discovering who had needed his services.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the child,&rdquo; she announced, returning to Eloise's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little thing,&rdquo; returned the girl, rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where are you going? Stay right where you are. She has a high fever, and
      they're not sure yet what it may be. Mrs. Forbes is doing everything that
      is necessary. Father has waited over two trains. He hasn't gone to the
      city yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At the mention of Mr. Evringham Eloise sank back in her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Ballard is coming again toward evening,&rdquo; continued Mrs. Evringham,
      &ldquo;and I shall talk with him and find out just the conditions. Mrs. Forbes
      is very unsatisfactory, but I can see that she thinks it may be something
      infectious.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise lifted a suddenly hopeful face. &ldquo;Then you would wish to leave at
      once?&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Father would surely hear to reason and send the child to the
      hospital. They are models of comfort in these days, and it is the only
      proper place for people to be ill. I shall speak to Dr. Ballard about it
      to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As soon as Eloise had seen her grandfather drive to the station she eluded
      her mother, and gathering her white negligee about her, went softly up to
      Jewel's room and stood at the closed door. All was still. She opened the
      door stealthily. With all her care it creaked a little. Still no sound
      from within. She looked toward the bed, saw the flushed face of the child
      and that she was asleep, so she withdrew as quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the day she inquired of Mrs. Forbes if she could be of any service,
      but the housekeeper received the suggestion with curt respect, assuring
      her that Dr. Ballard had said Jewel would sleep a good deal, and should
      not be disturbed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham overheard the question and welcomed the reply with relief.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel ate the bread and fruit and milk that Mrs. Forbes gave her for her
      late lunch, and said that she felt better.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look so,&rdquo; returned the housekeeper. The child had not once called her
      upstairs during the morning. She certainly was as little trouble as a sick
      child could be.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If 't was anybody else,&rdquo; mused Mrs. Forbes, regarding her, &ldquo;I should say
      that she sensed the situation and knew she'd brought it on herself and me,
      and was trying to make up for it; but nobody can tell what she thinks. Her
      eyes do look more natural. I guess Dr. Ballard's a good one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It don't seem to hurt you to swallow now,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm, it doesn't, she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, you see how foolish and naughty it was the way you behaved
      about having the doctor this morning. Look how much better you are
      already!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, I love Dr. Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You well may. He's done well by you.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes took the tray. &ldquo;Now do
      you feel like going to sleep again? The doctor won't come till about six
      o'clock. Your fever'll rise toward evening, and that's the time he wants
      to see you. I shall sleep in the spare room next you to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Forbes. You are so kind; but you won't have to,&rdquo; replied
      the child earnestly. &ldquo;Would you please draw up the curtains and put Anna
      Belle's clothes on the bed? Perhaps I'll dress her after a while. It
      doesn't seem fair to make her stay in bed when it wasn't her error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think you'd better keep your arms out,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes
      decidedly. &ldquo;I'll put up the curtains, but when you come to try to do
      anything you'll find you are very weak. You can ring the bell when you
      want to, you know. And don't take your medicine again for an hour after
      eating. I'd take another nap right away if I was you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had gone out, Jewel shook her head at the doll, whose face was
      smiling toward her own. &ldquo;You denied it, didn't you, dearie, the minute she
      said it,&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;Error is using Mrs. Forbes to hold me under
      mortal mind laws, but it can't be so, because God doesn't want it, and I'm
      not afraid any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel put her hand under her pillow and drew out the two slips of paper
      that bore her mother's messages. These she read through several times. &ldquo;Of
      course there are more, Anna Belle. I shouldn't wonder if there was one in
      every pocket, but I don't mean to hunt. Divine love will send them to me
      just when I need them, the way He did these. I'm sorry I can't dress you,
      dearie, because you've just reflected love all the time, and ought not to
      be in bed at all; but I must obey, you know, so there won't be discord.
      I'd love to just hop up and get your clothes, but you'll forgive me for
      not, I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Jewel put her hand under her pillow and drew forth her copy of
      &ldquo;Science and Health.&rdquo; &ldquo;I'll read to you a little, dearie.&rdquo; She opened the
      book to page 393 and read, &ldquo;Rise in the strength of Spirit to resist all
      that is unlike God.&rdquo; Jewel paused and thought for a minute. &ldquo;You might
      think, Anna Belle, that that meant rise against Mrs. Forbes, but it
      doesn't. It means rise against all error, and one error is believing that
      Mrs. Forbes is cross or afraid.&rdquo; She went on reading for several minutes,
      passing glibly over familiar phrases and sticking at or skipping words
      which presented difficulties.
    </p>
    <p>
      While she was thus employed Eloise again stole quietly to her cousin's
      door, and hearing the soft voice she grew pale. Her mother had exacted a
      promise from her that she would not enter the room until Dr. Ballard
      consented, so after a minute's hesitation she fled downstairs and found
      Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think the little girl must be worse! She is talking to herself
      incessantly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes regarded the pale face coldly. &ldquo;I guess there's some mistake.
      She was better when I saw her half an hour ago. I'll go up in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minute stretched to five; Jewel had slept scarcely at all the night
      before, and by the time the housekeeper had laboriously reached her door,
      her voice had grown fainter, then stopped, and she was sound asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish Mamzell would keep her finger out of this pie,&rdquo; soliloquized Mrs.
      Forbes as she retraced her steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Evringham returned from the city, his first question, as Zeke met
      him, was concerning Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother says she's slept the most of the day,&rdquo; replied the coachman, his
      head stiff in his high collar and his eyes looking straight ahead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. A good sign does she think, or is it stupor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't say, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the house, a long pasteboard box in his hands, Mr. Evringham
      found that his grandchild was still asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I fear the worst, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; he said with nervous curtness. &ldquo;When a
      stupor attacks children it is a very bad sign I am told. I'll just ring up
      Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did so, but the doctor had gone out and was intending to call at the
      park before he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think it is all right, Mr. Evringham,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes,
      distressed by her employer's uneasiness. &ldquo;Dr. Ballard expected she'd sleep
      a great deal. He told me not to disturb her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, very well then, perhaps it is not to be regretted. Kindly put those
      roses in the deep vase, Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo; She took up the box. &ldquo;Besides, Mr. Evringham, if she does get
      worse, you know the hospital here is one of the very best, and you&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham wheeled and frowned upon the speaker fiercely. &ldquo;Hospital!&rdquo;
       he ejaculated. &ldquo;An extraordinary suggestion, Mrs. Forbes! Most
      extraordinary! My granddaughter remains in my house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes, crimson with surprise and mortification, retreated. &ldquo;Very
      well, sir,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;Will you have the roses on the dinner table,
      Mr. Evringham?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Set them here on my desk if you please.&rdquo; With this Mr. Evringham
      began walking up and down the floor, pausing once to take up the yellow
      chicken. During the day the soft moan, &ldquo;I wanted you so all night,
      grandpa,&rdquo; had been ringing in his ears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes has no understanding of the child,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;and of
      course I cannot expect anything from the cat and her kitten.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With this he began again his promenade. Mrs. Forbes returned with the
      roses, and simultaneously Mr. Evringham saw Essex Maid arching her neck as
      she picked her steps past the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; he said curtly, &ldquo;let Zeke take the Maid back to the barn.
      I'll not ride to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very fine weather, sir,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll not ride. I'll wait here for Dr. Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper went forth to give the order.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw Mr. Evringham so upset in my life,&rdquo; she said in an awestruck
      tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I saw the governor wasn't real comfortable,&rdquo; returned the boy. &ldquo;Guess
      he's afraid he's goin' to catch the mumps or something. It would be real
      harrowin' if he got any worse case of big head than he's got already.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham was little accustomed to waiting, and by the time Dr.
      Ballard appeared, his nervousness had become painful. &ldquo;The child's slept
      too much, I'm sure of it, Ballard,&rdquo; was his greeting. &ldquo;I don't know what
      we're going to find up there, I declare I don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It depends on whether it's a good sleep,&rdquo; returned the doctor, and his
      composed face and manner acted at once beneficially upon Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you'll know, Guy, you'll know, my boy. Mrs. Forbes saw you coming,
      and she has gone upstairs to prepare the little girl. She'll be glad to
      see you this time, I'll wager.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker, roses in hand, ascended the staircase after the physician.
      Mrs. Forbes was standing at the foot of the bed, and the room was
      pleasantly light as they entered. Jewel, the flush of sleep on her cheeks,
      was looking expectantly toward the door. Dr. Ballard came in first and she
      smiled in welcome, then Mr. Evringham appeared, heavy roses nodding in all
      directions before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; exclaimed the child. &ldquo;Why, grandpa, did <i>you</i> come?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was no mistaking the joy in her tone. Dr. Ballard paused in
      surprise, while the stockbroker approached the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought you a few flowers, Jewel,&rdquo; he said, while she pressed his
      disengaged hand against her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're the most lovely ones I ever saw,&rdquo; she returned with conviction.
      &ldquo;They make me happy just to look at them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jewel,&rdquo; said the doctor, &ldquo;I hear you've been making up for lost
      sleep in great shape.&rdquo; His eyes, as he spoke, were taking in with
      concentrated interest the signs in her face. He came and sat beside the
      bed, while Mr. Evringham fell back and Mrs. Forbes regarded the child
      critically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, now, you're a good little patient,&rdquo; went on the doctor, as he noted
      the clear eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Dr. Ballard, I feel just as nice as can be,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No thickness in the voice. I fancy that sore throat is better.&rdquo; The young
      doctor could not repress his smile of satisfaction. &ldquo;I was certain that
      was the right attenuation,&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;Now let us see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out the little thermometer, and Jewel submitted to having it
      slipped beneath her tongue.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Dr. Ballard leaned back in his chair to wait, he looked up at Mr.
      Evringham. &ldquo;It is very gratifying,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to find these conditions at
      this hour of the day. I felt a little more uneasy this morning than I
      confessed.&rdquo; He nodded in satisfactory thought. &ldquo;I grant you medicine is
      not an exact science, it is an art, an art. You can't prescribe by hard
      and fast rules. You must take into consideration the personal equation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently he leaned forward and removed the thermometer. His eyes smiled
      as he read it, and he lifted it toward Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't see it, boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's nothing to see. She hasn't a particle of temperature. Look
      here, little one,&rdquo; frowning at Jewel, &ldquo;if everybody recovered as quickly
      as you have, where would we doctors be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning again and addressing Mr. Evringham, he went on, &ldquo;I'm particularly
      interested in this result because that is a remedy over which there has
      been some altercation. There's one man to whom I shall be glad to relate
      this experience.&rdquo; The doctor leaned toward his little patient. &ldquo;Jewel, I'm
      not so surprised as I might be at your improvement,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;You
      will have to excuse me for a little righteous deception. I put medicine
      into that glass of water, and now you're glad I did, aren't you? I'd like
      you to tell me, little girl, as near as you can, how often you took it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't take it,&rdquo; replied the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard drew back a little. &ldquo;You mean,&rdquo; he said after a moment, &ldquo;you
      took it only once?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, I didn't take it at all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a silence, during which all could hear the ticking of the clock
      on the table, and the three pairs eyes were fixed on Jewel with such
      varying expressions of amazement and disapproval that the child's breath
      began to come faster.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't you drink any of the water?&rdquo; asked Dr. Ballard at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, out of the pitcher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not out of the glass?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't look enough. I was so thirsty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They could not doubt her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham finally found his voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel, why didn't you obey the doctor?&rdquo; His eyes and voice were so
      serious that she stretched out her arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, grandpa,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;please let me take hold of your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not till you answer me. Little girls should be obedient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel thought a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said it wasn't medicine, so what was the use?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, seeming to find an answer to this difficult, bit the end of
      his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard was feeling his very ears grow red, while Mrs. Forbes's lips
      were set in a line of exasperation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; said Jewel, and the child's voice was very earnest, &ldquo;there's a
      Bible over there on the table. You look in there in the Gospels, and
      you'll find everywhere how Jesus tells us to do what I've done. He said he
      must go away, but he would send the Comforter to us, and this book tells
      about the Comforter.&rdquo; Jewel took the copy of &ldquo;Science and Health&rdquo; from
      under the sheet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God's creation couldn't get sick. It's just His own image and likeness,
      so how could it? And when you can get right into God's love, what do you
      want of medicine to swallow? God wouldn't be omnipotent if He needed any
      help. You see I'm well. Isn't that all you want, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The appeal of her eyes caused the broker to stir undecidedly. &ldquo;I never did
      have any use for doctors,&rdquo; he thought, after the manner of many who,
      nevertheless, are eager to fly to the brotherhood for help at the first
      suggestion of pain. Moreover, the humor of the situation was beginning to
      dawn upon him, and he admired the fine temper and self-control with which
      the young physician pulled himself together and rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> am glad you are well, Jewel, very,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but the next time
      I am called to prescribe for a little Christian Scientist I shall put the
      pellets on her tongue.&rdquo; He smiled as he took up his case and said good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham followed him down the stairs, heroically resisting the
      impulse to laugh. Only one remark he allowed himself as he bade the doctor
      good-by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're quite right, Ballard, in your theory. Jewel has been here only
      three days, but I could have told you that in doing anything whatever for
      her, it is always absolutely necessary to consider the personal equation.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN THE LIBRARY
    </h3>
    <p>
      As Mr. Evringham turned from the closed door he met his daughter-in-law
      coming out into the hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been watching for Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; she said with annoyance. &ldquo;I don't
      see why I didn't hear him come down.&rdquo; At this juncture she paused,
      surprised to observe that her father-in-law was laughing. She attributed
      this unusual ebullition to ridicule of herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only wanted to ask if Julia's illness is infectious,&rdquo; she went on with
      dignity. &ldquo;Eloise and I are naturally very anxious. We should like to do
      anything for her we can, if it is quite safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Madam, don't, I pray, for all our sakes, run any risk,&rdquo; returned Mr.
      Evringham, his lips still twitching as he bowed mockingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It would be very foolish,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Evringham, unabashed. &ldquo;You
      wouldn't care to have more invalids on your hands. It has been all I could
      do to keep Eloise away from the sick room to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo; commented Mr. Evringham, smoothing his mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not only possible but true, and I wished to go to headquarters and find
      out the exact state of the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again the broker's shoulders began to shake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ballard isn't headquarters,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham regarded him, startled. She wondered if affairs were
      perhaps very serious, and her father-in-law's nerves overstrained. She
      knew that he had dispensed with the afternoon ride which was so important
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She grew a shade paler. &ldquo;I wish you would tell me, father, just what the
      doctor said,&rdquo; she begged.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham raised a protesting hand. &ldquo;I couldn't think of it,&rdquo; he
      laughed. &ldquo;It would give me apoplexy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His daughter-in-law began to retreat, and the broker passed her and went
      into his study, still laughing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham stood with lips parted, looking after him. Her heart beat
      fast. The doctor had called twice. He had come down the stairs in dead
      silence just now. She knew it, for she had been listening and waiting to
      intercept him. She had meant to say a number of pretty things to him
      concerning Eloise's anxiety about her little cousin. Her own anxiety
      redoubled, and she hurried to her daughter's room and narrated her
      experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really think we may have to go, Eloise,&rdquo; she finished nervously. &ldquo;Even
      if it isn't infectious, it is so dreadfully dispiriting to be in a house
      where there is a dangerous illness, and possibly worse. I've been thinking
      perhaps we might go in town and take lodgings for a while. No one need
      know it. We could even stay there through the summer. None of our friends
      would be in town; then in autumn we could come back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's lip curled. &ldquo;I doubt that,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Grandfather will be
      forearmed. I prophesy, mother, that you will never get our trunks up here
      again after you once take them out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Eloise, you do put things most repulsively,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Evringham with vexation. &ldquo;Besides, how do we know what the future is going
      to bring forth? Father behaves to me as if he might be on the verge of
      brain fever himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little Jewel!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl. &ldquo;I hope she will pull through,
      but if she is the cause of our leaving here, I shall always love her
      memory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know whether father will even come to dinner,&rdquo; said Mrs.
      Evringham, pursuing her own thoughts, &ldquo;but I suppose we shall see Mrs.
      Forbes. I do hope she has some sense about using disinfectants. It's
      outrageous for her to come near the dining-room when she is taking care of
      that child. Of course they'll have a nurse at once. Forbes doesn't like
      going out of her beaten track.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't forget that poor little voice rambling on so monotonously this
      afternoon,&rdquo; said Eloise. &ldquo;I strained my ears to listen, but I could make
      out only that she said something about 'love' and then about
      'righteousness.' What a word for that little mouth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen smaller,&rdquo; remarked Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      When finally they entered the dining-room punctually at the appointed
      hour,&mdash;even Mrs. Evringham dared take no liberties with that,&mdash;the
      host was there and greeted them as usual. Mrs. Forbes came in and took her
      position near him. Her employer gave her a side glance. His fears for
      Jewel allayed, his regard for his housekeeper's opinions had returned in
      full force.
    </p>
    <p>
      He wished to ask for the little girl, to ask what she was doing now, and
      what she would like sent up for dinner, but he had not the courage. The
      aghast countenance which Mrs. Forbes had exhibited at the moment when the
      enormity of Jewel's conduct transpired remained in his memory. The
      housekeeper's appearance at present was noncommittal. Mrs. Evringham sent
      her piercing and questioning glances in vain.
    </p>
    <p>
      The silence in the usually silent room had not had time to become
      noticeable when the portiere was pushed aside and Jewel, arrayed in the
      dotted dress and carefully bearing the tall vase of nodding roses, entered
      the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham uttered a little cry and dropped her spoon. Eloise stared
      wild-eyed. The housekeeper flushed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good evening,&rdquo; said the child, glancing about as she approached, and
      sighing with relief as she set the heavy vase on the edge of the table. &ldquo;I
      had to come down so carefully not to spill, grandpa, that it made me a
      little late. Mrs. Forbes said you brought me the roses under false&mdash;false
      pretends, so I thought perhaps you would like them on the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper, hurrying forward, seized the vase from its precarious
      position and placed it in the centre of the board. &ldquo;I didn't tell you you
      might come downstairs,&rdquo; she said, as she buttoned the middle button of
      Jewel's dress.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl looked up in innocent surprise. &ldquo;You said I might dress
      me, so why should anybody have to bring up my dinner?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes's countenance looked so lowering that Mr. Evringham hastened
      to speak in his brusque and final fashion. &ldquo;She is here now. Might as well
      let her stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel jumped into her chair and turned toward him with an apologetic
      smile. &ldquo;I couldn't make my hair look very nice,&rdquo; she said, with the lift
      of her shoulders which he had come to connect with her confidential
      moments. Remembering the feverish child of the morning, he looked at her
      in silent wonder. The appearance of her flaxen head he could see was in
      contrast to the trim and well-cared-for look it had worn when she arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little thing!&rdquo; he thought. &ldquo;She looks motherless&mdash;motherless.&rdquo;
       Involuntarily he cast a glance of impatience at his other guests. The
      expression of blank amazement on their faces stirred him to amusement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you are afraid of infection, Madge, don't hesitate to retire to your
      room,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Your dinner will be sent to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What does this mean!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;Why is Dr. Ballard
      coming twice a day to see that child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To cure her, of course,&rdquo; returned the broker, his lips breaking into
      smiles. &ldquo;Why do doctors generally visit patients?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then when he came the second time he found her well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha, ha,&rdquo; laughed Mr. Evringham, &ldquo;yes, that's it. He found her well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise and her mother gazed at him in astonishment. Mrs. Forbes's face was
      immovable. A sense of humor was not included in her mental equipment, and
      she considered the whole affair lamentable and unseemly in the extreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa,&rdquo; said Jewel, looking at him with gentle reproach, &ldquo;you're not
      laughing at Dr. Ballard, are you? He's the <i>kindest</i> man. I love him,
      next to you, best of anybody in Bel-Air&rdquo;&mdash;then thinking this
      declaration might hurt her aunt and cousin, she added, &ldquo;because I know him
      the best, you know. He tried to deceive me about the medicine, but it was
      only because he didn't know that there isn't any righteous deceiving. He
      meant to do me good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked curiously from the child to her father-in-law. As
      she herself said later, she had never felt so &ldquo;out of it&rdquo; in her life. As
      the subject concerned Dr. Ballard, she wished to understand clearly what
      circumstance could possibly have induced Mr. Evringham to laugh
      repeatedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was passing your door this afternoon,&rdquo; said Eloise, addressing Jewel,
      &ldquo;and I heard you talking. I knew there was no one with you, and I feared
      you were very ill.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl was always pleased when her beautiful cousin looked at
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I was reading. Of course I was in a hurry to get well, so as soon
      as the fever was gone and I felt comfortable, I began to read out loud
      from 'Science and Health' to Anna Belle. She's a Christian Scientist,
      too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The faces of Mrs. Evringham and Eloise were studies as they gazed at the
      speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham glanced at them maliciously under his heavy brows as Sarah
      brought in the second course.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Anna Belle your doll?&rdquo; asked Eloise, for the moment sufficiently
      interested almost to lose her self-consciousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; eagerly. &ldquo;Would you like to see her?&rdquo; Jewel gave a fleeting glance
      at Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;She always comes to the table with me at home,&rdquo; she
      added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit still,&rdquo; murmured Mrs. Forbes in low, sepulchral warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Jewel,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham as he began to serve the filet, &ldquo;you
      didn't take the doctor's medicine. What do you think made that high fever
      go away?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl looked up brightly. &ldquo;Oh, I telegraphed to Mrs. Lewis, one
      of mother's friends in Chicago, to treat me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dev&mdash;What do you mean, child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham gazed at her, and his tone was so fierce, although he was
      only very much amazed, that Jewel's smile faded. The corners of her lips
      drew down pitifully, and suddenly she slipped from her chair, and running
      to him threw her arms around his neck and buried her averted face,
      revealing two forlorn little flaxen pigtails devoid of ribbons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this, Jewel?&rdquo; he said quickly, fearfully embarrassed before his
      wondering audience. &ldquo;This is very irregular, very irregular.&rdquo; He dropped
      his fork perforce, and his hand closed over the little arm across his
      cravat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel was trying to control a sob that struggled to escape, and saying
      over and over, as nearly as he could understand, something about God being
      Love.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go right back to your chair now, like a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you&mdash;love me?&rdquo; whispered Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You spoke like&rdquo;&mdash;a sob&mdash;&ldquo;like hating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, not at all,&rdquo; rejoined Mr. Evringham quickly, &ldquo;but I was very
      much surprised, very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I take her upstairs, sir?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Forbes, nearly bursting with
      the outrage of such an interruption to her employer's sacred dinner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, she's going to sit right down in her chair and not make any trouble.
      Don't you like those roses I brought you, Jewel?&rdquo; he added awkwardly,
      hoping to make a diversion. He was successful. She lowered her face, a
      fleeting April smile flitting over it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did grandfather bring you those lovely roses?&rdquo; asked Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham flashed her his first glance of approval for so quickly
      taking the cue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the child, her breath catching as she went back to her
      chair. &ldquo;I seemed so sick when he went away this morning was the reason; so
      now I'm well again&mdash;they belong to everybody, don't they, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham paused to consider a reply. He desired to be careful in
      public not to draw upon himself that small catapult.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to you still, Jewel. I never take back my presents,&rdquo; he
      returned at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And I think Mrs. Forbes was mistaken about the false pretends,&rdquo; said the
      child, swallowing and looking apologetically at the housekeeper, &ldquo;because
      who would pretend such error as sickness, and of course you'd know I
      didn't pretend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes didn't mean that. The
      whole thing seems like a dream now,&rdquo; he added.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What else could it seem like?&rdquo; returned Jewel, smiling faintly toward her
      grandfather with an air of having caught him napping.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like reality,&rdquo; he returned dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gazed at him, her smile fading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked up apprehensively and cringed a little, not at all sure that the
      next instant would not find the rose-leaf cheek next his, and a close
      whisper driving cold chills down his back; but the child only paused a
      moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reality is so much different from sin, disease, and death,&rdquo; she said at
      last, in a matter-of-fact manner. It was too much for Mrs. Evringham's
      risibles. She laughed in spite of her daughter's reproachful glance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderful if true!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is true,&rdquo; returned Jewel soberly. &ldquo;Even Anna Belle knows that; but I'm
      sure that you haven't learned anything about Christian Science, aunt
      Madge,&rdquo; she added politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you so sure?&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham banteringly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel flushed with embarrassment and glanced at her grandfather
      involuntarily, but he was busy eating and evidently would not help her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd rather not say,&rdquo; replied the child at last, and her rejoinder incited
      her aunt to further merriment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Madge doesn't laugh in a nice way,&rdquo; thought Jewel. &ldquo;It's even
      pleasanter when she looks sorry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is real then, Jewel?&rdquo; asked Eloise gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child flashed upon her a sweet look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything good and glad,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Something rose in the girl's throat, and she pressed her lips together for
      an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are happy to believe that,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't believe it,&rdquo; replied Jewel. &ldquo;It's one of the things I <i>know</i>.
      Mother says we only believe things when we aren't sure about them. Mother
      knows such a lot of beautiful truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked at her cousin wistfully as she spoke. Eloise could
      scarcely retain her proud and nonchalant bearing beneath the blue eyes.
      They seemed to see through to her wretchedness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not look at Jewel again during dinner. At the close Mr. Evringham
      pushed his chair back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like you to come with me into my study, Jewel, for a few
      minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's face brightened, and she left the table with alacrity. Mr.
      Evringham stood back to allow his guests to pass out. They went on to the
      drawing-room, where Mrs. Evringham's self-restraint was loosed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The plot thickens, Eloise!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we are not going away,&rdquo; returned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Decidedly not,&rdquo; declared her mother with emphasis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is no hope of our catching anything that Jewel has now,&rdquo; went on
      Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother glanced at her suspiciously. &ldquo;What, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned the girl, shrugging her shoulder, &ldquo;faith, hope, and
      charity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham laughed. &ldquo;Indeed! Is the wind in that quarter? Then with
      the Christian Science microbe in the house, there's no telling what may
      happen to you. Something more serious than a fever, perhaps.&rdquo; She nodded
      knowingly. &ldquo;This sudden recovery looks very queer to me. I'd keep the
      child in bed if I were in authority. Some diseases are so treacherous.
      There's walking typhoid fever, for instance. She may have it for all we
      know. I shall have a very serious talk with Dr. Ballard when he comes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      An ironical smile flitted over the girl's lips as she drifted toward the
      piano. &ldquo;I judge from the remarks at the table, that the less you say to
      Dr. Ballard on the subject of to-day's experiences the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; indignantly. &ldquo;I'm sure that child must have played some
      practical joke on him. I want to get to the bottom of it. What a strange
      little monkey she is! How long will father stand it? What did you think,
      Eloise, when she swooped upon him so suddenly?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought of just one sentence,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;'Perfect love
      casteth out fear.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why in the world should she love him?&rdquo; protested Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She would love us all if we would let her,&rdquo; returned Eloise, the phrases
      of &ldquo;Vogel als Prophete&rdquo; beginning to ripple softly from beneath her
      fingers. &ldquo;I saw it from the first. I felt it that first evening, when we
      behaved toward her like a couple of boors. Any one can see she has never
      been snubbed, never neglected. She got out of the lap of love to come to
      this icebox. No wonder the change of temperature made her ill!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eloise, what has come over you? You never used to be disagreeable.
      It's a good thing the child is amiable. It's the only thing left for a
      plain girl to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No one will ever remember that she is plain,&rdquo; remarked Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother raised her eyebrows doubtingly. &ldquo;Perhaps your perceptions are
      so keen that you can explain how Jewel managed to telegraph to Chicago
      to-day,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It reminded me of Dooley's comments on Christian
      Science. Do you remember what he said about 'rejucin' a swellin' over a
      long distance tillyphone'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't imagine how she managed it,&rdquo; admitted Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Neither could Mr. Evringham. He had taken Jewel into his study now with
      the intention of finding out, deeming a secluded apartment more desirable
      for catechism which might lay him liable to personal attack.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they entered the library he turned on the light, and Jewel glanced
      about with her usual alert and ready admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this your own, own particular room, grandpa?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, where I keep all my books and papers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's eye suddenly lighted on the yellow chicken, and she looked up
      at Mr. Evringham with a pleased smile. He had forgotten the chicken, and
      took the seat before his desk, glancing vaguely about to see which chair
      would be least heavy and ponderous for his guest. She settled the matter
      without any hesitation by jumping upon his knee. Jewel had a subject on
      her mind which pressed heavily, and before her companion had had time to
      do more than wink once or twice in his surprise, she proceeded to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know, grandpa, I think it's hard for Mrs. Forbes to love people
      very much,&rdquo; she said in a lowered voice, as if perhaps the walls might
      have ears. &ldquo;I wanted to ask her yesterday morning if she didn't love me
      whom she had seen, how could she love God whom she hadn't seen. Grandpa,
      would you be willing to tie my bows?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tie&rdquo;&mdash;repeated Mr. Evringham, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child was gazing into his eyes earnestly. She put her hand into her
      pocket and took out two long pieces of blue ribbon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, you're my only real relation,&rdquo; she explained, &ldquo;and so I don't
      like to ask anybody else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The startled look in her grandfather's face moved her to proceed
      encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You tie your neckties just beautifully, grandpa; and Mrs. Forbes does her
      duty so <i>hard</i>, and she wants to have my hair cut off, to save
      trouble.&rdquo; Jewel put her hand up to one short pigtail protectingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you don't want it cut off, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; and mother wouldn't either. So it would be error, and I'm sure I
      could learn to fix it better than I did to-night, if you would tie the
      bows. Just try one right now, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With the house full of women!&rdquo; gasped Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But none of them my real relatives,&rdquo; replied Jewel, and she turned the
      back of her head to him, putting the ribbons in his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      His fingers fumbled at the task for a minute, and his breathing began to
      be heavy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it hard, grandpa?&rdquo; she asked sympathetically. &ldquo;You can do it. You
      reflect intelligence.&rdquo; Then in an instant, &ldquo;Oh, I've thought of
      something.&rdquo; She whisked about, took the ribbons and tied one tightly
      around the end of each braid, then ducking her forehead into his shirt
      front, &ldquo;Now put your arms around my neck and tie the bow just as if it was
      on yourself.&rdquo; Eureka! The thing was accomplished and Mrs. Forbes
      outwitted. The broker was rather pleased with himself, at the billowy
      appearance of the ribbon which covered such a multitude of sins in the way
      of bad parting and braiding. He took his handkerchief and wiped the beads
      of perspiration from his brow, while Jewel regarded him with admiring
      affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you could do just <i>anything</i>, grandpa!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You see,&rdquo;
       looking off at a mental vision of the housekeeper, &ldquo;we could come in here
      every morning for a minute before breakfast, and she'd never know, would
      she?&rdquo; The child lifted her shoulders and laughed softly with pleasure at
      the plot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham saw his opportunity to take the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now Jewel, I would like to have you explain what you meant by saying that
      you telegraphed to Chicago to-day, when you didn't leave your bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him attentively. &ldquo;Ezekiel took it for me,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham unconsciously heaved a sigh of relief at this commonplace
      information. His knowledge of the claims of Christian Science was
      extremely vague, and he had feared being obliged to listen to a
      declaration of the use of some means of communication which would make
      Marconi's discoveries appear like clumsy makeshifts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think, grandpa, perhaps you'd better not tell Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you manage to see Zeke?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked his mother if he might come to see me before he took you to the
      train.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham pulled his mustache in amusement. &ldquo;Did he pay for the
      telegram?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why no, grandpa. I told you I had plenty of money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you think that Mrs. Somebody in Chicago cured you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not. God did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she asked Him, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's innocent eyes looked directly into the quizzical ones. &ldquo;It's
      pretty hard for a little girl to teach you about it if you don't know,&rdquo;
       she said doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>don't</i> know,&rdquo; he replied, his mood altered by her tone, &ldquo;but I
      should like to know what you think about it. Your cure was a rather
      surprising one to us all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can tell you some of the things I know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do so then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&rdquo;&mdash;a pause&mdash;&ldquo;there wasn't anything to cure, you see.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! You weren't ill then!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o,&rdquo; scornfully, &ldquo;of course not. I knew it all the time, but it
      seemed so real to me, and so hot, I knew I'd have to have some one else
      handle the claim for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly did seem rather real.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel saw that he did not in the least comprehend.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know there isn't any devil, don't you, grandpa?&rdquo; she asked patiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sometimes I have my doubts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl tried to discover by his eyes if he were in earnest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you believe there is, then you could believe that I was really sick;
      but if you believe there isn't, and that God created everybody and
      everything, then it is so easy to understand that I wasn't. Think of God
      creating anything bad!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham nodded vaguely. &ldquo;When mother comes home she'll tell you
      about it, if you want her to.&rdquo; She sighed a little and abruptly changed
      the subject. &ldquo;Grandpa, are you going to be working at your desk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Could I sit over at that table and write a letter while you're busy? I
      wouldn't speak.&rdquo; She slipped down from his knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know about your having ink. You're a rather small girl to be
      writing letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, I'll take a pencil&mdash;because sometimes I move quickly and ink
      tips over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quite so. I'm glad you realize that, else I should be afraid to have you
      come to my study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better not be afraid,&rdquo; the child shook her head sagely, &ldquo;because
      that makes things happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grandfather regarded her curiously. This small Bible student, who
      couldn't tie her own hair ribbons, was an increasing problem to him.

    <h3>
      FAMILY AFFAIRS
    </h3>
    <p>
      He continued to watch the child furtively, while she made her arrangements
      for writing. Finding that no chair in the room would bring her to a proper
      height for the table, she looked all about, and finally skipped over to
      the morocco lounge and tugged from it a pillow almost too heavy for her to
      carry; but she arrived with it at the chair, much to the amusement of Mr.
      Evringham, who affected absorption in his papers, while he enjoyed the
      exhibition of the child's energy and independence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the kind that 'makes old shears cut,' as my mother used to say,&rdquo; he
      mused, and turning, the better to view the situation, he found Jewel
      mounted on her perch and watching him fixedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked relieved. &ldquo;I didn't want to disturb you, grandpa, but may I ask
      one question?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I consult Dr. Ballard this afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I noticed,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham; and Jewel suspected from his
      expression that she had said something amusing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it was a word that sounded like consult that Mrs. Forbes said I
      did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Insult, perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. How do you spell it, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham told her, and added dryly, &ldquo;That was rather too strong
      language for Mrs. Forbes to apply to the fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;I knew it was a hating word.&rdquo; Then without
      further parley she squared her elbows on the table and bent over her sheet
      of paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what version of it she'll give her mother,&rdquo; thought the broker,
      rummaging vaguely in the pigeon holes of his desk. His labors finally
      sifted down to the unearthing of a late novel from a drawer at his right
      hand, and lowering a convenient, green-shaded electric light, he lit his
      cigar, and was soon lost in the pages of the story.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he became conscious that the pencil at the table had ceased to
      move, and lowering his book he looked up. His granddaughter had been
      watching for this happy event, and she no sooner met his eyes than, with a
      smile of satisfaction, she jumped from her morocco perch and brought him a
      sheet of paper well and laboriously covered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose it isn't all spelled right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I didn't want to
      disturb you to ask; but will you please direct this to Dr. Ballard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To Dr. Ballard!&rdquo; repeated Mr. Evringham. His curiosity impelled him.
      &ldquo;Shall I see if it is spelled right?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel assenting, he read the following in a large and waving hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR DOCTOR BALUD&mdash;Mrs. Forbs felt bad because I did not take your
      Medsin. She said it was an insult. I want to tell you I did not meen an
      Insult. We can't help loving God beter than any body, but I love you and
      if I took any medsin I would rather take yours than any boddy's. Mrs.
      Forbs says you will send a big Bill to Grandpa and that it was error to
      waist it. Please send the Bill to me because I have Plenty of munny, and I
      shall love to pay you. You were very kind and did not put any thing on my
      Tung.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your loving JEWEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham continued to look at the signature for a minute before he
      spoke. Jewel was leaning against his arm and reading with him. The last
      lines slanted deeply, there being barely room in the lower corner for the
      writer's name.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't write very straight without lines,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do very well indeed,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;About that bill, Jewel,&rdquo; he added
      after a moment. &ldquo;Perhaps you would better let me pay it. I believe you
      said you had three dollars, but even that won't last forever, you know.
      You've spent some of it, too. How much, now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've spent fifty cents.&rdquo; Jewel cast a furtive look around at the chicken,
      &ldquo;And, oh yes, fifty cents more for the telegram. How much do you think Dr.
      Ballard's bill will be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it will take every cent you have left,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham,
      gravely, curious to hear what his granddaughter would say in this dilemma.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her reply came promptly and even eagerly. &ldquo;Well, that's all right, because
      Divine Love will send me more if I need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? How can you be sure?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel smiled at him affectionately. &ldquo;Do you mean it grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes. I really want to know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even after God sent you Essex Maid?&rdquo; she asked incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think the mare is the best thing in my possession, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es! Don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe I do.&rdquo; As Mr. Evringham spoke, this kinship of taste induced
      him to turn his face toward the one beside him. Instantly he found himself
      kissed full on the lips, and while he was recovering from the shock, Jewel
      proceeded:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God has given you so many things, grandpa, that's why it surprised me to
      have you look so sorry when I first came.&rdquo; The child examined his
      countenance critically. &ldquo;I don't think you look so sorry as you used to. I
      know you must have lots of error to meet, and perhaps,&rdquo; lowering her voice
      to an extra gentleness, &ldquo;perhaps you don't know how to remember every
      minute that God is a very present help in trouble. Mother says that even
      grown-up people are just finding out about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she paused Mr. Evringham hesitated, somewhat embarrassed under the blue
      eyes. &ldquo;We all have plenty to learn, I dare say,&rdquo; he returned vaguely.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had more than once wished that he had taken more notice of Harry's wife
      during his opportunity at the hotel. He had looked upon the interview as a
      distasteful necessity to be disposed of as cursorily as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      His son had married beneath him, some working girl probably, whose ability
      to support herself had turned out to be a deliverance for her
      father-in-law when the ne'er-do-well husband shirked his responsibilities;
      and Mr. Evringham had gone to the hotel that evening intending to make it
      clear that although he performed a favor for his son, there were no
      results to follow.
    </p>
    <p>
      His granddaughter's fearlessness, courtesy, and affection had forced him
      to wonder as to the mother who had fostered these qualities. He remembered
      the eloquence of his son's face when Harry expressed the wish that he
      might know Julia, and a vague admiration and respect were being born in
      the broker's heart for the deserted woman who had worked with hand and
      brain for her child&mdash;his grandchild was the way he put it&mdash;with
      such results as he saw.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some perception of what Harry's sensations must have been during the last
      six months came to him as he sat there with the little girl's arm about
      him. Harry had come home and discovered his child, his Jewel. A frown
      gathered on the broker's brow as he realized the hours of vain regret his
      son must have suffered for those lost years of the child's life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Served him right, served him perfectly right!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question made Mr. Evringham aware that the indignant words had been
      muttered above his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking of your father,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;Has he learned these things
      that your mother has taught you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; with soft eagerness; &ldquo;father is learning everything.&rdquo; Jewel saw
      her grandfather's frown and she lowered her voice almost to a whisper.
      &ldquo;Don't feel sorry about father, grandpa. He says he's the happiest man in
      the world. Mother didn't find out about God till after father had gone to
      California, or he wouldn't have gone; and for a long time she didn't know
      where he was, and I was only beginning to walk around, so I couldn't help
      her; but when I got bigger I had father's picture, and we used to talk to
      it every day, and at last mother knew that Divine Love would bring father
      back; and pretty soon he began to write to her, and he said he couldn't
      come home because he felt so sorry, and he was going to the war. So then
      mother and I prayed a great deal every day, and we knew father would be
      taken care of. And then mother kept writing to him not to be sorry,
      because error was nothing and the child of God could always have his right
      place, and everything like that, and at last the war was over and he came
      home.&rdquo; Jewel paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham wondered what she was seeing with that far-away look.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she turned to him with the smile of irresistible sweetness&mdash;Harry's
      smile&mdash;and a surprising fullness came in the broker's throat.
      &ldquo;Father's just splendid,&rdquo; she finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grandfather was not wholly pleased with the verdict. He had gained a
      taste for incense himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He has been at home over six months, I believe,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, all winter; and we have more <i>fun</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father is not a Christian Scientist, I presume,&rdquo; remarked Mr.
      Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, he's learning to be. Of course he goes to church&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does, eh?&rdquo; put in the broker, surprised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course; and he studies the lesson with us every day. He had been sorry
      so much and so long, you know, mother said he was all ready; and beside&mdash;beside&rdquo;&mdash;Jewel
      hesitated and became silent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Beside what?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She began very softly and half reluctantly. &ldquo;Father had a sickness two or
      three times when he first came home, and he was healed, and so he was very
      grateful and wanted to know about God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. I'm glad he was. I hope he will make your mother very happy after
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does.&rdquo; The child lost her seriousness and laughed reminiscently.
      &ldquo;Father and I have the <i>best</i> times. Mothers says he's younger than I
      am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You miss him, eh?&rdquo; Mr. Evringham half frowned into the fresh little face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I do,&rdquo; with a sigh, &ldquo;but it would be error to be sorry when I
      could come to see you, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham cogitated a minute on the probable loneliness of the last
      three days, and began to wonder what this philosophy could be which gave
      practical help to a child of eight years. He was still holding the letter
      to Dr. Ballard in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I'll let you direct this yourself, Jewel,&rdquo; he said. He rose and
      brought the morocco cushion to his desk chair. &ldquo;Sit up here and I will
      tell you the address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, and Mr. Evringham watched the little fingers clenched around
      the pen as she strove to resist its tendency to write down hill on the
      envelope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you're quite sure that more money will be forthcoming when yours is
      gone, eh?&rdquo; he asked when the feat was accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; if I need it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How will it come, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked up quickly. &ldquo;I don't need to know that,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham bit his lip. &ldquo;That's unanswerable,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;and rather
      neat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment a knock sounded at the library door, and a moment afterward
      Mrs. Forbes presented herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Evringham. I'm afraid Julia has been in your way, staying
      so long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Mrs. Forbes, thank you,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;She had a letter to write, and
      I have been reading.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. It is her bedtime now.&rdquo; The housekeeper's tone was inexorable,
      and Jewel lifted her shoulders as she glanced up at her grandfather, and
      again he found himself taken into a confidence which excluded his
      excellent housekeeper. &ldquo;It is better for us to yield,&rdquo; said Jewel's
      shoulders and mute lips. Before Mr. Evringham could suspect her intention,
      she had jumped up on the cushion nimbly as a squirrel, and hugging him in
      a business-like manner, kissed him twice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Jewel,&rdquo; he returned, going to the length of patting her
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      She jumped down and ran to Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;You needn't come with me, you
      know,&rdquo; she said, holding up her face. Mrs. Forbes hesitated a moment. She
      had not as yet recovered from this latest liberty taken with the head of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me feel of your hands, Julia.&rdquo; She took them in hers and touched the
      child's cheeks and forehead as well. &ldquo;You seem to feel all right, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No soreness or pain anywhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No'm. Good-night, Mrs. Forbes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper stooped from her height and accepted the offered kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you prefer to go alone, Jewel? Isn't it lonely for you?&rdquo; asked Mr.
      Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o, grandpa! Anna Belle is up there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're not afraid of the dark then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked at the speaker, uncertain of his seriousness. He seemed in
      earnest, however. &ldquo;The dark is easy to drive away in this house,&rdquo; she
      replied. &ldquo;It is so interesting, just like a treatment. The room seems full
      of darkness, error, and I just turn the switch,&rdquo; she illustrated with
      thumb and finger in the air, &ldquo;and suddenly&mdash;there isn't any darkness!
      It's all bright and happy, just like me to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham, standing with his feet apart and his
      arms folded. &ldquo;Is that what the lady in Chicago did for you to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, grandpa,&rdquo; Jewel nodded eagerly. She was so glad to have him
      understand. &ldquo;She just turned the light, Truth, right into me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She prayed to the Creator to cure you, you mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked off. &ldquo;No, not that,&rdquo; she answered slowly, searching for words
      to make her meaning plain. &ldquo;God doesn't have to be begged to do anything,
      because He can't change, He is always the same, and always perfect, and
      always giving us everything good, and it's only for us&mdash;not to
      believe&mdash;in the things that seem to get in the way. I was believing
      there was something in the way, and that lady knew there wasn't, and she
      knew it so <i>well</i> that the old dark fever couldn't stay. Nothing can
      stay that God doesn't make&mdash;not any longer than we let it cheat us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And she was a thousand miles away,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, grandpa,&rdquo; returned Jewel, &ldquo;there isn't any space in Spirit.&rdquo; She
      gave a little sigh. &ldquo;I'm real sorry you're too big to be let into the
      Christian Science Sunday-School.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes lips fell apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;One moment more, Jewel,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes was telling me
      of the gentleman who spoke to you on the trolley car yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; returned the child, smiling at the pleasing memory. &ldquo;The
      Christian Scientist!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What makes you think he is a Christian Scientist?&rdquo; asked Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he was. He had on the pin.&rdquo; Jewel showed the one she wore, and her
      grandfather examined the little cross and crown curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder if it's possible,&rdquo; he soliloquized aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, grandpa, he is one, and if he's a friend of yours he can explain
      to you so much better than a little girl can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After the child had left the room Mr. Evringham and his housekeeper stood
      regarding one another. His usually unsmiling countenance was relaxed. Mrs.
      Forbes observed his novel expression, but did not suspect that the light
      twinkling in his deep-set eyes was partly due to the sight of her own
      pent-up emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hooked one thumb in his vest and balanced his eyeglasses in his other
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what do you think of her?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, sir,&rdquo; returned the housekeeper emphatically, &ldquo;that if anybody
      bought that child for a fool he wouldn't get his money's worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even though she is a Scientist?&rdquo; added Mr. Evringham, his mustache
      curving in a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's too smart for me. I don't like children to be so smart. The idea of
      her setting up to teach you Mr. Evringham!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That shouldn't be so surprising. I read a long time ago something about
      certain things being concealed from the wise and prudent and revealed unto
      babes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Babes!&rdquo; repeated Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;We've been the babes. If that young one
      can lie in bed with a fever, and wind every one of us around her finger
      the way she's done to-day, what can we expect when she's up and around?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker laughed. &ldquo;She's an Evringham, an Evringham!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may laugh, sir, but what do you think of her wheedling me into
      sending Zeke up, and then getting him off on the sly with that telegram? I
      faced him down with it to-night, and Zeke isn't any good at fibbing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be hanged if I don't think it was a pretty good thing for me,&rdquo;
       rejoined Mr. Evringham, &ldquo;and money in my pocket. It looked as if I was in
      for Ballard for a matter of weeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the&mdash;the&mdash;the audacity of it!&rdquo; protested Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;What
      do you think she said after you and Dr. Ballard had done downstairs? I
      tried to bring her to a sense of what she'd done, and all she answered was
      that she had known that God would deliver her out of the snare of the
      fowler. Now I should like to ask you, Mr. Evringham,&rdquo; added Mrs. Forbes in
      an access of outraged virtue, &ldquo;which of us three do you think she called
      the fowler?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give it up, I'm sure,&rdquo; returned the broker; &ldquo;but I can imagine that we
      seemed three pretty determined giants for one small girl to outwit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'd outwit a regiment, sir; and I don't see how you can permit it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham endeavored to compose his countenance. &ldquo;We must allow her
      religious liberty, I suppose, Mrs. Forbes. It's a matter of religion with
      her&mdash;that is, we must allow it as long as she keeps well. If Ballard
      had found her worse to-night, I assure you I should have consigned all
      Christian Scientists to the bottom of the sea, and that little zealot
      would have taken her medicine from my own hand. All's well that ends well,
      eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes had caught sight of the incongruous adornment of her
      employer's desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      With majestic strides she advanced upon the yellow chicken and swept it
      into her apron. &ldquo;Julia must be taught not to litter your room, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; returned the broker firmly, also advancing and
      holding out his hand. &ldquo;That is my chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Slowly Mrs. Forbes restored the confiscated property, and Mr. Evringham
      examined it carefully to see that it was intact, and then set it carefully
      on his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes recalled the confectioner's window. &ldquo;She must have bought that
      chicken when my back was turned!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;That young one could have
      given points to Napoleon.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A RAINY MORNING
    </h3>
    <p>
      The next morning it rained so heavily that Mr. Evringham was obliged to
      forego his ride. Wet weather was an unmixed ill to him. It not only made
      riding and golf miserable, but it reminded him that rheumatism was getting
      a grip on one of his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is disgusting, perfectly disgusting to grow old,&rdquo; he muttered as he
      descended the broad staircase. On the lower landing Jewel rose up out of
      the dusk, where she had been sitting near the beautiful clock. Her bright
      little face shone up at him like a sunbeam.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't expect to see me, grandpa, did you?&rdquo; she asked, and as it did
      not even occur to him to stoop his head to her, she seized his hand and
      kissed it as they went on down the stairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so disappointed because it rained so hard. I was going to see you
      ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Beastly weather,&rdquo; assented Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the flowers and trees want a drink, don't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'M. I suppose so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And the brook will be prettier than ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'M. See that you keep out of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I will, grandpa; and I thought the first thing this morning, I'll
      wear my rubbers all day. I was so afraid I might forget I put them right
      on to make sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the hall, and Jewel exhibited her feet encased in the
      roomy storm rubbers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, child!&rdquo; ejaculated Mr. Evringham, viewing the shiny
      overshoes. &ldquo;What size are your feet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; returned the little girl, &ldquo;but I only have to scuff some,
      and then they'll stay on. Mrs. Forbes said I'd grow to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you will, I should think, if you're going to wear them in the house as
      well as out.&rdquo; It was against Mr. Evringham's principles to smile before
      breakfast, at all events at any one except Essex Maid; but the large,
      shiny overshoes that looked like overgrown beetles, and Jewel's optimistic
      determination to make him happy, even offset his painful arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The house doesn't leak anywhere,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I think it will be safe for
      you to take them off until after breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel lifted her shoulders and looked up at him with the glance he knew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unless we're going out to the stable,&rdquo; she said suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated a moment. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;Let us go to the
      stable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But first we must tie the ribbons,&rdquo; she said with a joyous chuckle. She
      would have skipped but for the rubbers. As it was, she proceeded
      circumspectly to the library, drawing the broker by the hand. &ldquo;I want you
      to see, grandpa, if you don't think I made my parting real straight this
      morning,&rdquo; she said as she softly closed the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gently on my arm, Jewel,&rdquo; he remonstrated, wincing as she returned,
      flinging her energetic little body against him. &ldquo;I have the rheumatism
      like the devil&mdash;pardon me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him suddenly, wondering and wistful. &ldquo;Oh, have you?&rdquo; she
      returned sympathetically. &ldquo;But it is only like the devil, grandpa,&rdquo; she
      added hopefully, &ldquo;and you know there isn't any devil.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't discuss theology before breakfast,&rdquo; he returned briefly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear grandpa, you shan't have a single pain!&rdquo; She held her head back and
      looked at him lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very likely not, when I've begun playing the harp. Now where are those
      con&mdash;those ribbons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eyes and lips grew suddenly serious and doubtful, and he observed
      the change.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, your hair ribbons, you know,&rdquo; he added hastily and with an attempt
      at geniality.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not if you don't like to, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love to,&rdquo; he protested. &ldquo;I've been looking forward to it all the
      morning. I thought 'never mind if I can't go riding, I can tie Jewel's
      hair ribbons.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child laughed a little, even though her companion did not. &ldquo;Oh
      grandpa, you're such a joker,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;just like father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he saw that she doubted his mood, and the toe of one of the overshoes
      was boring into the carpet as she stood where she had withdrawn from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let us see if you parted your hair better,&rdquo; he said in a different and
      gentler tone, and instantly the flaxen head was bent before him, and Jewel
      felt in her pocket for the ribbons. He had not the heart to say what he
      thought; namely, that her parting looked as though a saw had been
      substituted for a comb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, very well,&rdquo; he said kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the ribbons were at last tied, the two proceeded to the dining-room.
      Here an open fire of logs furnished the cheerful light that was lacking
      outside. The morning paper hung over the back of a chair, warming before
      the blaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes entered from the butler's pantry and looked surprised. &ldquo;I
      didn't expect you down for half an hour yet, sir. Shall I hurry
      breakfast?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I'm going to take Jewel to the stable.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham stopped and
      took a few lumps of sugar from the bowl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Julia, where are your rubbers?&rdquo; asked the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On,&rdquo; said the child, lifting her foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I only hope they'll stay there,&rdquo; remarked her grandfather. &ldquo;I think, Mrs.
      Forbes, you must buy shoes as I've heard that Chinamen do,&mdash;the
      largest they can get for the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He disappeared with his happy little companion, and the housekeeper looked
      after them disapprovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're both going out bareheaded,&rdquo; she mused. &ldquo;I'd like to bet&mdash;I
      would bet anything that she asked him to take her. He never even stopped
      to look at the paper. He's just putty in her hands, that's what he is,
      putty; and she's been here three days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham's apprehensions proved to have foundation. Halfway to the
      barn Jewel stepped in a bit of sticky mud and left one rubber. Her
      companion did not stop to let her get it, but picking her up under his
      well arm, strode on to the barn, where they appeared to the astonished
      Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel was laughing in high glee. She was used to being caught up in a
      strong arm and run with.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham shook the drops from his head. &ldquo;Get Jewel's rubber please,
      Zeke,&rdquo; he said, pointing with his thumb over his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was Cinderella,&rdquo; cried the child gayly. &ldquo;That's my glass slipper out
      there in the mud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke would have liked to joke with her, but that was an impossibility in
      the august presence. He cast a curious glance at the little girl as he
      left the barn. He had received his mother's version of yesterday's
      experience. &ldquo;Well, it looks to me as if there was something those
      Christian Science folks know that the rest of us don't,&rdquo; he soliloquized.
      &ldquo;I saw her with my own eyes, and felt her with my own hands. Mother says
      children get up from anything twice as quick as grown folks, but I don't
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you love a stable, grandpa?&rdquo; exclaimed Jewel. &ldquo;Oh, I'm too happy to
      scuff,&rdquo; and she kicked off the other rubber. Even while she spoke Essex
      Maid looked around and whinnied at sight of her master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She knows you, she knows you,&rdquo; cried the little girl joyously, hopping up
      and down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham, holding out his hand to the delighted
      child and leading her into the stall. The mare rubbed her nose against
      him. &ldquo;We couldn't get out this morning, eh, girl?&rdquo; said the broker,
      caressing her neck, while Jewel smoothed the bright coat as high as she
      could reach. Her grandfather lifted her in his arms. &ldquo;Here, my maid,
      here's a new friend for you. In my pocket, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child took out the lumps of sugar one by one, and Essex Maid ate them
      from the little hand, touching it gently with her velvet lips. Zeke came
      in and whistled softly as he glanced at the group in the stall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;He's letting her feed the Maid. I guess she can put her
      shoes in <i>his</i> trunk all right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham set Jewel on the mare's back and she smoothed the bright
      mane and patted the beautiful creature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to gallop off now over the whole country,&rdquo; she said, her face
      glowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shouldn't be surprised either if you could do it bareback,&rdquo; returned
      Mr. Evringham; &ldquo;but you must never come into either of the stalls without
      me. You understand, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, grandpa. I'm glad you told me though, because I guess I should
      have.&rdquo; The child gave a quick, unconscious sigh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well we'd better go in now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How kind you are to me,&rdquo; said the child gratefully, as she slid off the
      horse's back with her arms around her grandfather's neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had forgotten his rheumatic shoulder for the time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can bring those rubbers in later,&rdquo; he said to Zeke, and so carried
      Jewel out of the barn, through the rain, and into the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes watched the entrance. &ldquo;Breakfast is served, sir,&rdquo; she said
      with dignity. She thought her employer should have worn a hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel was not offered eggs this morning. Instead she had, after her fruit
      and oatmeal, a slice of ham and a baked potato.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her roses were fresh this morning and opening in the warmth of the fire,
      but Mr. Evringham's eyes were caught by a mass of American Beauties which
      stood in an alcove close to the window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where did those come from?&rdquo; he demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They belong to Miss Eloise,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Forbes. &ldquo;She asked me to take
      care of them for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Ballard again, I suppose,&rdquo; remarked the broker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Forbes devoutly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham had spoken to himself, and he glanced up from his paper,
      surprised by the prompt fervor of the reply. The housekeeper looked
      non-committal, but her meaning dawned upon him, and he smiled slightly as
      he returned to the news of the day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Ballard must love Cousin Eloise very much,&rdquo; said Jewel, mashing her
      potato. &ldquo;He sent her a splendid box of candy, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She addressed her remark to Mrs. Forbes, and in a low tone, in order not
      to disturb her grandfather's reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any girl can get candy and flowers and love, if she's only pretty
      enough,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Forbes; &ldquo;but she mustn't forget to be pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker's tone appealed to Jewel as signifying a grievance. She looked
      up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, somebody married you, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham's paper hid a face which suddenly contorted, but the
      housekeeper's quick-glancing eyes could not see a telltale motion.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a hard little laugh. &ldquo;You think there's hope for you then, do
      you?&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess I'm not going to be married,&rdquo; replied Jewel. &ldquo;Father says I'm
      going to be his bachelor maid when I grow up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shouldn't wonder if you were,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes dryly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of the American Beauties and the beribboned bonbon box was
      taking her coffee as usual in bed. This luxurious habit had never been
      hers until she came to Bel-Air; but it was her mother's custom, and rather
      than undergo a tete-a-tete breakfast with her host, she had adopted it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now she had made her toilet deliberately. There was nothing to hurry for.
      Her mother's voice came in detached sentences and questions from the next
      room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, this rain is too trying, Eloise! Didn't you have some engagement
      with Dr. Ballard to-day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thought he could get off for some golf this afternoon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a disappointment for the dear fellow,&rdquo; feelingly. &ldquo;He has so little
      time to himself!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise gave a most unsympathetic laugh. &ldquo;More than he wishes he had, I
      fancy,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She came finally in her white negligee into her mother's room. Mrs.
      Evringham was still in bed. Her eyeglasses were on and she regarded her
      daughter critically as she came in sight. She had begun to look upon her
      as mistress of the fine old Ballard place on Mountain Avenue, and the
      setting was very much to her mind. The girl sauntered over to the window,
      and taking a low seat, leaned her head against the woodwork, embowered in
      the lace curtains.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How it does come down!&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham fretfully. &ldquo;And I lack just a
      little of that lace braid, or I could finish your yoke. I suppose Forbes
      would think it was a dreadful thing if I asked her to let Zeke get it for
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't ask anything,&rdquo; returned Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you are in your own home!&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't, mother. It's indecent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you would only reassure me, my child, so I wouldn't have to undergo
      such moments of anxiety as I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you have no mercy!&rdquo; exclaimed the girl; and when she used that tone
      her mother usually became tearful. She did now.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You act as if you weren't a perfect treasure, Eloise&mdash;as if I didn't
      consider you a treasure for a prince of the realm!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A knock at the door heralded Sarah's arrival for the tray, and Mrs.
      Evringham hastily wiped her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you can take the things,&rdquo; she said as the maid approached. &ldquo;I can't
      tip you as I should, Sarah. I'm going to get you something pretty the next
      time I go to New York.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sarah had heard this before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if you know of any one going to the village this morning, I want a
      piece of lace braid. Have you heard how Miss Julia is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was down at breakfast, ma'am, and Mr. Evringham had her out to the
      stable to see Essex Maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He did? In the rain? How very imprudent!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After Sarah had departed with her burden, Mrs. Evringham took off her
      eyeglasses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, Eloise, you heard that? It's just as I thought. He is taking a
      fancy to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled without turning her head. &ldquo;Oh no, that wasn't your
      prophecy, mother. You said she was too plain to have a chance with our
      fastidious host.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, didn't she look forlorn last night at the dinner table?&rdquo; demanded
      Mrs. Evringham, a challenge in her voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed she did, the poor baby. She looked exactly as if she had two
      female relatives in the house, neither of whom would lift a finger to help
      her, even though she was just off a sick bed. The same relatives don't
      know this minute how or where she spent the evening.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I felt very glad she was content somewhere away from the drawing-room,&rdquo;
       returned Mrs. Evringham practically. &ldquo;You know we expected Dr. Ballard up
      to the moment the roses arrived, and from all I gathered at the dinner
      table, it would have been awkward enough for him to walk in upon that
      child. Besides, I don't see why you use that tone with me. It has been
      your own choice to let her paddle her own canoe, and you've had an object
      lesson now that I hope you won't forget. You wouldn't believe me when I
      begged you to exert yourself for your grandfather, and now you see even
      that plain little thing could get on with him just because she dared take
      him by storm. She has about everything in her disfavor. The child of a
      common working woman, with no beauty, and a little crank of a Christian
      Scientist into the bargain, and yet now see! He took her out to the stable
      to see Essex Maid! I never knew you contradictory and disagreeable until
      lately, Eloise. You even act like a stick with Dr. Ballard just to be
      perverse.&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham flounced over in bed, with her back to the white
      negligee.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise had seen what she had been watching for. Her grandfather had driven
      away to the station, so she arose and came over to the foot of the bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I'm irritable, mother,&rdquo; she said repentantly. &ldquo;The idleness and
      uselessness of my life have grated on me until I know I'm not fit to live
      with. If I had had any of the training of a society girl, I could bear it
      better; but papa kept my head full of school,&mdash;for which I bless him,&mdash;and
      now that the dream of college is hopeless, and that the only profession
      you wish for me is marriage, I dread to wake up in the mornings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young voice was unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham heaved a long sigh. &ldquo;Give me patience!&rdquo; she murmured, then
      added mentally, &ldquo;It can't be many days, and she won't refuse him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go down to the piano and play yourself good-natured,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Then
      come up and we'll go on with that charming story. It quite refreshed me to
      read of that coming-out ball. It was so like my own.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise, her lips set in a sad curve, rose and left the room. Once in the
      hall, she paused for a minute. Then instead of descending the stairs, she
      ran noiselessly up the next flight. The rain was pelting steadily on the
      dome of golden glass through which light fell to the halls. She stole, as
      she had done yesterday, to the door of Jewel's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again as yesterday she heard a voice, but this time it was singing. The
      tones were very sweet, surprisingly strong and firm to proceed from lips
      which always spoke so gently. The door was not quite closed, and Eloise
      pressed her ear to the crack. Thus she could easily hear the words of
      Jewel's song:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And o'er the earth's troubled, angry sea
     I see Christ walk;
     And come to me, and tenderly,
     Divinely, talk.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The hymn stopped for a minute, and the child appeared to be conversing
      with some one.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise waited, openly, eagerly listening, hoping the singer would resume.
      Something in those unexpected words in the sweet child voice stirred her.
      Presently Jewel sang on:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;From tired joy, and grief afar,
     And nearer Thee,
     Father, where Thine own children are
     I love to be!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The lump that rose in the listener's throat forced a moisture into her
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never could hear a child sing without crying,&rdquo; she said to herself in
      excuse, as she leaned her forehead on her hand against the jamb of the
      door and waited for the strange stir at her heart to quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      The house was still. The rain swept against the panes, and tears stole
      from under the girl's long lashes&mdash;tears for her empty, vapid life,
      for the hopelessness of the future, for the humiliations of the present,
      for the lack of a love that should be without self-interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I like that verse, Anna Belle,&rdquo; said the voice within. &ldquo;Let's sing that
      again,&rdquo; and the hymn welled forth:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;From tired joy, and grief afar,
     And nearer Thee,
     Father, where Thine own children are
     I love to be!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there a haven?&rdquo; thought the swelling, listening heart outside. &ldquo;Is
      there a place far alike from tired joy and grief?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Father, where Thine own children are,'&rdquo; quoted Jewel. &ldquo;We know where a
      lot of them are, don't we, Anna Belle, and we do love to be with them.&rdquo; A
      pause, and a light sigh, which did not reach the listener. &ldquo;But we're at
      grandpa's now,&rdquo; finished the child's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's breaths came long and deep drawn, and she stood motionless, her
      eyes hidden.

      CHAPTER XVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE FIRST LESSON
    </h3>
    <p>
      Jewel looked up as she heard a knock. Sarah had made the bed and gone. Who
      could this be?
    </p>
    <p>
      At her &ldquo;Come in,&rdquo; Eloise entered the room. The child's face brightened
      questioningly. She rose and gazed at the enchanted maiden, very lovely in
      the wrapper of white silk, open at the throat, and with little billows of
      lace cascading down to the toes of her white Turkish slippers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; said the child, waiting for the message or
      order which she supposed to be forthcoming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning.&rdquo; The girl cast a comprehensive glance around the rather
      bare room. Her eyes bore no traces of the tears so recently shed, but her
      face was sad. &ldquo;I heard you singing,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Did I disturb anybody?&rdquo; asked the child quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It is nice to be like the birds that sing in the rain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Like the robin out there,&rdquo; returned Jewel, relieved. &ldquo;Did you hear him?&rdquo;
       She ran to the window and threw it open, listening a minute. &ldquo;No, he has
      gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you would show me your doll,&rdquo; went on Eloise when the window was
      closed again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; returned Jewel pleased, &ldquo;did you come to see Anna Belle? She's right
      here. We were just going to have the lesson.&rdquo; She took the doll from the
      depths of a big chair and held her up with motherly pride. &ldquo;Would you&mdash;won't
      you sit down a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To her great satisfaction, her beautiful visitor condescended to take the
      chair Anna Belle had vacated, and held out her white, ringless hands for
      the doll.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How neatly her clothes are made,&rdquo; said the girl, examining Anna Belle's
      garments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my mother made her all new ones when she knew she was going to
      Europe, so that she would be neat and not mortify me. Would you like to
      see her clothes?&rdquo; eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel brought them, her quick little fingers turning them back and forth,
      exhibiting the tiny buttonholes and buttons, and chattering explanations
      of their good points.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a great deal for your mother to do all this, when she is such a
      busy woman,&rdquo; said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she did it evenings, and then surprised me just when we were coming
      away. Wasn't it lovely?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I love prettiness,&rdquo; said the child. As she spoke she regarded the grave
      face beside her. &ldquo;When I first noticed that my nose wasn't nice, and
      neither were my eyes, I almost cried.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise looked up at her, at a loss for a reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then I remembered that of course God never made anything that wasn't
      perfectly beautiful, so I knew that it would come right some time, and I
      asked mother when she thought it would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did she say?&rdquo; returned Eloise, wondering at this original optimism.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said we could never tell how soon anything would come right to our
      sense, but so long as we knew that Creation was perfect and beautiful, we
      could be patient about everything&mdash;big things and little things; and
      then I remember how she talked to me about being careful never to pity
      myself.&rdquo; Jewel gave her head a little serious shake. &ldquo;You know it's very
      bad error to pity yourself, no matter what kind of a nose you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise had sunk back in the large chair and was attentively watching the
      child standing beside her, while she still held Anna Belle. She had never
      before held converse with a Christian Scientist, but her state of mind
      precluded the perception of a humorous side to anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wrong to pity yourself no matter what happens?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;because&mdash;because&mdash;&rdquo; Jewel looked off. She knew that
      it was error, but it was hard to explain why to the lovely grown-up cousin
      who was so strangely sorry. &ldquo;Well, you see,&rdquo; she added after the moment's
      thought, &ldquo;it isn't having faith in God, it isn't knowing that you're His
      child, and that He takes care of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I suppose not; but I have never learned how to know that, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you haven't,&rdquo; returned the little girl, and she slipped her hand
      toward her cousin's. The girl met it halfway and held it close. &ldquo;Since
      I've seen you,&rdquo; Jewel went on slowly, &ldquo;I know that prettiness isn't enough
      to make a person happy&mdash;nor all your lovely clothes&mdash;nor having
      people fond of you and sending you presents&mdash;nor making the sweetest
      music; but you can be happy, cousin Eloise, unless you're doing wrong.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am doing wrong, but I can't help it.&rdquo; The girl took her supporting hand
      from the doll and pressed it to her eyes a second before dropping it.
      &ldquo;What were you doing when I came in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just going to get the lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do you go on with your studies? Perhaps I can help you better than
      Anna Belle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you cousin Eloise?&rdquo; Jewel flushed with pleasure. &ldquo;Some of the words
      are so long. I thought I'd ask grandpa to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you wish to come to me?&rdquo; questioned Eloise, well knowing why.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl looked a trifle embarrassed. &ldquo;I didn't want to trouble
      you. Of course you aren't my real relations,&rdquo; she said modestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember that, too!&rdquo; exclaimed Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel started at the hurt voice. &ldquo;Would you like to be?&rdquo; she asked
      earnestly. &ldquo;I wish you were, because&rdquo;&mdash;she hesitated and smiled with
      her head a little on the side, &ldquo;because I might look more like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The gravity of Eloise's lips remained unbroken. &ldquo;I want you to promise me
      something, Jewel. I want you to promise not to tell your grandfather that
      I have been with you to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? He'd be glad I was happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a reason. I will help you with your studies every day if you won't
      tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I might without meaning to,&rdquo; rejoined the child, her alert little mind
      busy with the new problem suddenly presented to it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will make a rainbow scarf for Anna Belle if you will never speak of me
      to your grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why do you say my grandfather? He's yours, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Didn't you just say I was not your real relation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh but, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; Jewel was sure of the hurt now, though the why or
      wherefore was a mystery, &ldquo;of course he wishes you were.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no he doesn't.&rdquo; The answer came quick and sharp, and the child
      reviewed mentally her own observations of the household. Her heart swelled
      with the desire to help.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; her breath came a little faster with the thronging
      thoughts for which her vocabulary was insufficient, &ldquo;error does try to
      cheat people so. Just think how kind you were inside all the time, though
      you wouldn't smile at me. You're willing to make Anna Belle a scarf. I
      called you the enchanted maiden, because you were too sorry to try to make
      people happy, and now grandpa's just like that; he's enchanted, too, if he
      doesn't make you happy, because he's just as <i>kind</i> inside, oh, just
      as <i>kind</i> as he can be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He likes you,&rdquo; returned Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel regarded her for a silent moment. &ldquo;I noticed when I came,&rdquo; she said
      at last, apologetically, &ldquo;that nobody here seemed to love one another; and
      the house was so grand and the people were so beautiful that I couldn't
      understand; and I called it Castle Discord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise gave a little exclamation. &ldquo;I call it the icebox,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's face lighted. &ldquo;That's it, that's all it is,&rdquo; she said eagerly.
      &ldquo;It's easy to melt ice. Love melts everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's pretty slow work sometimes,&rdquo; said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you have to put on more love. That's all. Have you&rdquo;&mdash;the child
      asked the question a little timidly, &ldquo;have you put on much love to
      grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should I love him?&rdquo; asked Eloise. &ldquo;He doesn't love me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear,&rdquo; said Jewel. After a minute's thought her face brightened. &ldquo;I
      guess I'll show you my dotted letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran to the closet where hung her dotted challie dress and took from
      the pocket the message that had come to her the evening of her arrival.
      &ldquo;My mother put a letter into all my pockets for a happy surprise; and this
      one came the first night, when I was feeling all sorry and alone, and it
      comforted me. Perhaps it will comfort you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the paper into the girl's hand, and Eloise read it. She turned it
      over and read it a second time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel stood beside her chair watching, and seeing that her cousin seemed
      interested, she ran and brought her little wrapper. &ldquo;Perhaps you'd like to
      see this one too,&rdquo; she said feeling in the pocket for the second message.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise accepted and read it. Every word of the two notes came to the mind
      of the young girl as suggestions from another planet, so foreign were they
      to any instruction or advice that had ever fallen to her lot.
    </p>
    <p>
      She gave a slight exclamation as she finished. &ldquo;Is your mother a saint?&rdquo;
       she asked, looking up suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned Jewel innocently. &ldquo;She's a Christian Scientist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise suddenly put out her hand, and drawing Jewel to her, hid her
      forehead on the child's breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you were older,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel put her little hands on the shining waves of hair she had admired
      from afar. &ldquo;I wish my mother was here,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Did you like those
      things mother said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; but they're from heaven, and I'm in the other place,&rdquo; replied
      Eloise disconsolately.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let's look in another pocket!&rdquo; exclaimed Jewel. &ldquo;I'll look in my
      best dress. Perhaps she'd put the best one there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl lifted her head, and the child went eagerly to the closet, coming
      back with a folded paper. &ldquo;We'll read it together. You read it out loud,
      and I'll look over your shoulder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rain slanted against the window in gusts as the two heads bent above
      the paper. Eloise read:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother is thinking of you, little daughter, every day and every night,
      and the thing she hopes the most is, that you never let the day go by
      without studying the lesson. The words may be hard sometimes, but perhaps
      some one will read it with you, and if they do not, then you go on trying
      your best, and you will learn more and more all the time; for truth will
      shine into your thought and help you. Grandpa will give you plenty of
      bread and butter, but you must remember that Spirit, not matter,
      satisfieth. You would starve without the Bible and the text-book, and very
      soon the joy would go out of everything. Give my love to Anna Belle, and
      tell her not to go out to play any day until you have read the lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother speaks as if you learned Christian Science out of the Bible,&rdquo;
       said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; returned Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought a woman got it up,&rdquo; said the girl. &ldquo;I thought your church
      worshipped her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child smiled at the phrase. &ldquo;You know Christ was the first one. That's
      why we call ourselves that. We couldn't be Christian Scientists if we
      worshipped any one but God,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Of course we love Mrs. Eddy.
      Just think how good and unselfish a person has to be before they can hear
      God's teaching. He showed her how to remind people of the things that
      Christ taught, and how to get rid of their sins and sickness. We love her
      dearly for helping people so much, and shouldn't you think everybody
      would? But they don't. Some people think hating thoughts about her, just
      as if she was teaching bad things instead of good ones. Mother says it
      reminds her of what the Saviour said, 'For which of these works do ye
      stone me?'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you see,&rdquo; returned Eloise, &ldquo;Christian Scientists let people die
      sometimes without a doctor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But lots of people they do cure are the ones doctors said would have to
      die.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they claim that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a lot of people pass on while doctors are taking care of them I
      wonder why it makes everybody so angry when a Scientist goes without any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise smiled faintly as she shook her head. &ldquo;It is more respectable to
      die with a doctor at your side,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really willing to help me with the lesson, cousin Eloise? If you
      are, it would be nice if you would get your Bible too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked embarrassed. &ldquo;I haven't any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, your mother's would do just as well,&rdquo; said Jewel politely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She hasn't any&mdash;here, I'm sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl stood very still a moment. &ldquo;No wonder they're sorry,&rdquo; she
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. We can both look over one,&rdquo; she answered, and going to the
      dresser she brought her books.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was this the study you meant?&rdquo; asked Eloise, looking at the three books
      curiously. &ldquo;I thought I was offering to help you with something I knew
      about. I used to learn verses out of the Bible when I was a little girl in
      Sunday-school. I don't know anything about it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can read everything, the big words and all,&rdquo; replied Jewel. &ldquo;I
      wish I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise saw that this reply was designed to minister to her self-respect.
      She took up the small black book lying with the Bible. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is 'Science and Health,' that Mrs. Eddy wrote to explain to us what
      the Bible means; and this other one is to tell us where to pick out the
      places for the day's lesson.&rdquo; Jewel pulled up a chair, and seating
      herself, turned over the leaves of the Quarterly briskly until she found
      the right date.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please find Zechariah, cousin Eloise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that?&rdquo; asked the girl helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's in the Old Testament. Would you rather I'd find them? All right,
      then you can take 'Science and Health' and find that part.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it's easy, for I'm awfully stupid, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's very easy. You'll see.&rdquo; The child found the chapter and verse in
      the Bible and read, with her finger on the line. Eloise looked over and
      read with her. Thus they went through all the verses for the day, then
      Jewel began to give the page and line to be read in the text-book.
    </p>
    <p>
      This volume was small and agreeable to handle, the India paper pleasant to
      the girl's dainty touch. According to the child's request, she read aloud
      the lines which were called for.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all,&rdquo; said Jewel at last. &ldquo;Oh cousin Eloise, it's just lovely and
      easy to get the lesson with you,&rdquo; she added gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise made no response. Her eye had been caught by a statement on the
      page before her, and she read on in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel waited a minute and then, seeing that her cousin was absorbed, she
      laid down the Quarterly and took up her doll and sat still, watching the
      pretty profile, undisturbed by doubts as to what her cousin might think of
      the book she held, and full of utter confidence that He who healeth all
      our diseases would minister to her through its pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last Eloise again became conscious of her surroundings. She turned to
      her companion, a skeptical comment on her lips, but she suppressed the
      words at sight of the innocent, expectant face. She certainly had nothing
      to give this child better than what she already possessed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can read it any time when you feel sorry, cousin Eloise, that and my
      Bible too. Mother always does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does she ever feel sorry?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes; but it can't last where the Bible is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw that the Bible had anything to do with us,&rdquo; said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;ee!&rdquo; Jewel suddenly dropped Anna Belle and again took up the
      Bible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you think I opened to?&rdquo; holding the verse with her finger as she
      looked up. Then she read, &ldquo;'If ye love them that love you what thank have
      ye?' Now isn't that something to do with you and grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how I can love people who don't choose to be lovable,&rdquo;
       returned Eloise. &ldquo;What's the use of pretending?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But then,&rdquo; said the child, &ldquo;the trouble is that everything that isn't
      love is hate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her visitor raised her eyebrows. &ldquo;Ah! I should have to think about that,&rdquo;
       she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you'd better,&rdquo; agreed Jewel. Then she turned to the Psalms and read
      the ninety-first.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she had finished she looked up at her cousin, an earnest questioning
      in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is very beautiful,&rdquo; said Eloise. &ldquo;I never heard it before. How well
      you read it, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;It's so much easier to read things when you
      know them by heart.&rdquo; Then she turned to the Twenty-third Psalm and read
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've heard that one. It's beautiful of course, but I never thought
      of its having anything to do with us.&rdquo; Eloise was watching her cousin
      curiously. It seemed too strange for belief that a healthy child of her
      age should be taking a vital interest in the Bible and endeavoring to
      prove a position from its pages.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the girl finally rose to go she turned at the door:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Remember your promise not to tell grandfather about this morning,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel, hovering about her, looked troubled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you just as lief tell me why?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise gave the ghost of a smile. &ldquo;It would be a long story, and I
      scarcely think you would understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I could obey you better if you would tell me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. We, my mother and I, are not Mr. Evringham's real relations,&mdash;to
      put it as you do,&mdash;and we have come here because my poor father lost
      his money and we have nowhere else to go. We came without being invited,
      and it hurts to have to stay where we are not wanted. I don't wish
      grandfather to think that I am being kind to you, for fear he will believe
      that I am doing it to make him like me better and because I want to stay
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl spoke slowly and with great clearness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked at her, speechless with surprise and perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise went on: &ldquo;I don't want to stay here, you understand. I wish to go
      away. I would go to-day if my mother were willing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her large eyes grew dark as she closed, and the child received a sense of
      the turbulence that underlay her words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you for explaining,&rdquo; she returned in an awed tone. &ldquo;I wish my
      mother was here; but God is, and He'll take care of you, cousin Eloise.
      Mother says we don't ever need to stay in the shadow. There's always the
      sunshine, only we must do our part, we must come into it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How Jewel? Supposing you don't know how.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can learn how,&rdquo; replied the child earnestly, &ldquo;right in those books.
      Lots of sorry people grow glad studying them.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      JEWEL'S CORRESPONDENCE
    </h3>
    <p>
      While Jewel still stood turning over in her mind what she had heard,
      charming strains of music began coming up through the hall. Cousin Eloise
      had gone to the piano.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I almost which I hadn't made her tell me,&rdquo; thought the child, &ldquo;for how
      can I help grandpa not to be sorry they are here? Wouldn't I be sorry to
      have aunt Madge come and live with me when I never asked her to?&rdquo; She
      stood for some minutes wrestling with the problem, but suddenly her
      expression changed. &ldquo;I was forgetting!&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I mustn't get
      sorry too. God is All. Mortal mind can't do anything about it.&rdquo; She closed
      her eyes, and pressing her hand to her lips, stood for a minute in mute
      realization; then with a smile of relief, she took up Anna Belle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let's go down, dearie, and hear the music,&rdquo; she said light heartedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the summons to luncheon sounded and Mrs. Evringham entered the
      parlor, she found the child curled up in a big chair, her doll in her lap,
      listening absorbedly to the last strains of a Chopin Ballade.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like music, Julia?&rdquo; she asked patronizingly, as her daughter
      finished and turned about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The child's name is Jewel,&rdquo; said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, aunt Madge, I love it,&rdquo; replied the little girl; &ldquo;and I didn't know
      people could play the piano the way cousin Eloise does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham smiled. &ldquo;I suppose you've not heard much good music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes'm, I've heard our organist in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And Jewel can make good music herself,&rdquo; said Eloise. &ldquo;She can sing like a
      little lark. I've been up in her room this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham welcomed the look on her daughter's face as she made the
      statement. &ldquo;Thank fortune Eloise has played herself into good humor,&rdquo; she
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? I must hear her sing some time. You're playing unusually well
      this morning, my dear. I wish Dr. Ballard could have heard you. Come to
      luncheon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The three repaired to the dining-room, where Mrs. Forbes's glance
      immediately noted the presence of Anna Belle. She took her from Jewel's
      arms and placed her on a remote corner of the sideboard, in the middle of
      which glowed the American Beauty roses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham approached them with solicitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're looking finely, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said suavely. &ldquo;You surely
      understand the care of roses.&rdquo; She lifted the silver scissors that hung
      from her chatelaine and succeeded in severing one of the long stems.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, little girl,&rdquo; she added, advancing to Eloise, &ldquo;you need this in
      your white gown to cheer us up this rainy day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl shrank and opened her lips to decline, but restrained herself and
      submitted to have the flower pinned amid her laces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gazed at her in open admiration. The glowing color lent a wonderful
      touch to the girl's beauty. Mrs. Evringham laughed low at the fascinated
      look in the plain little face, and luncheon began.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jewel it differed much from the ones that had preceded it. Mrs. Forbes
      might hover like a large black cloud, aunt Madge might rail at the weather
      which cut her off from her afternoon drive, but the morning's experience
      seemed to have put the child into new relations with all, and Eloise often
      gave her a friendly glance or smile as the meal progressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was destined to a surprising interruption. In the midst of the
      discussion of lamb chops and Saratoga chips the door opened, and in walked
      Dr. Ballard. The shoulders of his becoming raincoat were spangled with
      drops, his hat was in his hand, a deprecatory smile brightened his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive me, won't you?&rdquo; he said as he advanced to Mrs. Evringham and
      clasped the outstretched hand which eagerly welcomed him. &ldquo;It was my one
      leisure half hour to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He brought the freshness of the spring air with him, and he went on around
      the table shaking hands with the others, and finally drew up a chair
      beside Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't eat anything,&rdquo; he declared in response to the urging of Mrs.
      Evringham and the housekeeper. &ldquo;Can't stay long enough for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His eyes fastened on the graceful girl opposite him, who was trying to
      offset her blushes by a direct and nonchalant gaze. The rose on her breast
      seemed to be scorching her cheeks. She knew that her mother was exulting
      in the lucky inspiration which had made her set it there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How good of you to come and cheer us!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;Do take
      off your coat and stay for a cosy hour. We will have some music.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't tempt me. I have an office hour awaiting me. I came principally to
      see this little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel had leaned back in her chair and was watching his bright face
      expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad of it,&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Evringham devoutly. &ldquo;I distrust these
      sudden recoveries, Dr. Ballard. Do make very sure that she hasn't one of
      those lingering, treacherous fevers. I've heard of such things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard's eyes laughed into those of his little neighbor. &ldquo;She doesn't
      look the part,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gave a glance around the table. &ldquo;Will you excuse me?&rdquo; she said
      politely, then she reached up to the doctor's ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shall I go and get my money?&rdquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he replied in a low tone. &ldquo;I came to thank you
      very much for your note, and to tell you that you don't owe me anything.
      I'm not usually a 'no cure, no pay' doctor. I take the money anyway, but
      this time I'm going to make an exception.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; asked Jewel, speaking aloud as long as he did.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you see, you didn't take the medicine. That makes a difference.
      Most people take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;es,&rdquo; rejoined Jewel rather doubtfully. She was not sure of this
      logic.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So now we're perfectly square,&rdquo; went on the doctor, &ldquo;but don't you fall
      ill again.&rdquo; He shook his head at her. &ldquo;I want us to remain friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'd always be friends, wouldn't we?&rdquo; returned Jewel, smiling into his
      laughing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When is our golf coming off, Miss Eloise?&rdquo; he asked, looking across the
      table again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When the weather permits,&rdquo; she responded graciously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that's going to be all right,&rdquo; commented Mrs. Forbes mentally.
      &ldquo;She's as pretty as a painting with that rose on, and her mother looks as
      contented as a cat with her paw on a mouse. She don't mean to play with
      that mouse, either. She won't run any risks. She'll take it right in.
      You're pretty near done for, my young feller, and your eyes look willing,
      I must say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The spring rain proved to be a protracted storm. Mr. Evringham made his
      hours long in the city. Eloise came up to Jewel's room each morning and
      read the lesson with her, always reading on to herself after it was
      finished. She made the child tell her of the circumstances of her recent
      illness and cure, and listened to Jewel's affectionate comments on Dr.
      Ballard's kindness with an inscrutable expression which did not satisfy
      the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You love him, don't you?&rdquo; asked the little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise gave a slight smile. &ldquo;If everything that isn't love is hate, I
      suppose I ought to,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; agreed Jewel; &ldquo;and he has been so kind to you I don't see
      how you can help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl sighed. &ldquo;Don't grow up, Jewel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It makes lots of
      trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the second one of her visits to the child's room she put her hand on
      the flaxen head. &ldquo;I'd like to fix your hair,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes
      doesn't part it nicely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do it myself,&rdquo; returned Jewel; &ldquo;but I'd be glad to have you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So Eloise washed the thick flaxen locks and dried them. Then she parted
      and brushed the hair, and when it was finally tied, Jewel regarded the
      reflection of her smooth head with satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks just the way mother makes it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm going to write to
      mother and father to-night, and I'm going to tell them how kind you are to
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      That evening, in Mr. Evringham's library, Jewel wrote the letter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her grandfather, after making some extremely uncomplimentary comments upon
      the weather, had lowered his green-shaded electric light and established
      himself beneath it with his book.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked across at the child, who was situated as before at the table,
      her crossed feet, in their spring-heeled shoes, dangling beneath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I smoke, Jewel?&rdquo; he asked, as he took a cigar from the case. He asked
      the question humorously, but the reply was serious.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, grandpa, of course; this is your room; but you know nobody likes
      tobacco naturally except a worm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham's deep-set eyes widened. &ldquo;Is it possible? Well, we're all
      worms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel smiled fondly at him, her head a little on one side, in its
      characteristic attitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're such a joker,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you really dislike smoke,&rdquo; said the broker after a minute, &ldquo;perhaps
      you'd better take your letter up to your room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't mind it,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;Father used to smoke. It's only a little
      while since it gave him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean since he gave it up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. When people study Christian Science, the error habits that they have
      just go away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? I'm glad you warned me.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham blew a delicate ring of
      smoke toward the table, but Jewel had begun to think of her parents, and
      her pencil was moving. Her grandfather noted the trim appearance of the
      bowed head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know but I was cut out for a man milliner after all,&rdquo; he mused
      complacently. &ldquo;Those bows have really a very chic appearance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His book interested him, and he soon became absorbed in its pages. Jewel
      occasionally coming to an orthographic problem looked up and waited, but
      he did not observe her, so she patiently kept silence and resumed her
      work. At last the letter was finished.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked again at her grandfather, and opened her cramped little hand
      with relief. The back of her neck was tired with her bending posture. She
      leaned back in the heavy chair to rest it while she waited. The eyelids,
      grown heavy with her labors, wavered and winked. The rain dripped down the
      panes, as if it had fallen into a monotonous habit. The sound was
      soothing. Jewel fell asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      When finally Mr. Evringham glanced at her he smiled. &ldquo;Little
      thoroughbred,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;she'd never disturb me.&rdquo; He rose and crossed to
      the child. There lay the finished letter. He took it up with some
      anticipation:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR MOTHER AND FATHER&mdash;&mdash;It is most time to get a leter from
      you but I will not wait to tell you I am happy and well.
    </p>
    <p>
      Grandpa is the kindest man and he has the most Beautiful horse, her name
      is Essecks made. He let me sit on her back and give her Sugar. Cosin
      Elloees is the prettiest one of all. She has things that make her sorry
      but she is very kind to me. She washed my hare today and she helps me get
      the lesson. There is a docter here he is lovly. He tried to cure me when I
      had a claim but Mrs. Lewis did. Cosin Elloees reads S. and H when we get
      throo the lesson and I think she will be glad Pretty soon and not afrade

      loving him. I love you both every minnit and the leters in my pocket help
      me so much.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your dear
    </p>
    <p>
      JEWEL.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham had scarcely finished reading this epistle when Jewel's head
      slipped on the polished woodwork against which she was leaning and bumped
      against the side of the chair with a jar which awoke her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Seeing her grandfather standing near she smiled drowsily. &ldquo;I fell asleep,
      didn't I?&rdquo; she said, and rubbed her eyes; then noting the sheet of paper
      in Mr. Evringham's hand, memory returned to her. She sat up with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, grandpa, you haven't read my letter!&rdquo; she exclaimed, with an accent
      of dismay which brought the blood to the broker's face. He felt a culprit
      before the shocked blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;to see if it was spelled right, you know,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You had me
      do it before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I wanted you to then,&rdquo; returned the child; &ldquo;but it is error to read
      people's letters unless they ask you to, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's confoundedly bad form, Jewel. I beg your pardon. You didn't
      mean me to see those sweet things you said about me, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That was no matter. It was cousin Eloise's secret. She trusted me.&rdquo; The
      child's eyes filled with tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker cleared his throat. &ldquo;No harm done, I'm sure. No harm done,&rdquo; he
      returned brusquely, to cover his discomfiture. For the first time he made
      an advance toward his granddaughter. &ldquo;Come here a minute, Jewel.&rdquo; He took
      her hand and led her to his chair, and seating himself, lifted her into
      his lap. The corners of her lips were drawing down involuntarily, and as
      her head fell against his broad shoulder, he took out his handkerchief and
      dried her eyes. &ldquo;I hope you'll forgive me,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;After this I will
      always wait for your permission. Now what is this about cousin Eloise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel shook her head, not trusting herself to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can't tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't you think perhaps it was a good thing I read your letter after
      all, if it is something I ought to know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker was not so interested to discover the secrets of his beautiful
      guest as to set himself right with this admirer. He did not relish falling
      from his pedestal.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think perhaps Divine Love made you do it, grandpa?&rdquo; asked the
      child tremulously, with returning hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham was quite certain that it had been curiosity, but he was
      willing to accept a higher sounding hypothesis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother explained to me about God making 'the wrath of man to praise
      Him,'&rdquo; added Jewel after the moment's pause. &ldquo;If it makes you kind to
      cousin Eloise, perhaps we can be glad you read it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is the matter with Eloise?&rdquo; asked Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel sat up, fixed him with her eyes, pressed her lips together, and
      shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won't tell me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The head went on firmly shaking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then let me read the letter again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, grandpa,&rdquo; decidedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He kept one arm around her as he smoothed his mustache. &ldquo;Is there
      something you think I ought to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A light seemed to illumine the eyes that the little girl kept fixed on
      his, but she did not speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think it discourteous for me to spend my evenings away from those
      two? They don't want me, child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still she did not speak. Mr. Evringham was divided between a desire to
      shake her and the wish to see the familiar fondness return to her face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wrote that Eloise thinks I do not want her and her mother here. Her
      intelligence is of a higher order than I feared. Well, what can be done
      about it? I've been asking myself that for some time. How would it do to
      settle some money upon them and then say good-by?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you did it with love,&rdquo; suggested Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my impression that they could dispense with the love under those
      circumstances.&rdquo; The broker gave a slight smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child put an impulsive little hand on his shoulder. &ldquo;No indeed,
      grandpa. Nobody can do without love. It hurts cousin Eloise because she
      isn't your real relation. She doesn't know how kind you are inside.&rdquo; The
      child's lips closed suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She fixed your hair very nicely,&rdquo; Mr. Evringham viewed the flaxen head
      critically. &ldquo;That's one thing in her favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's full of things in her favor,&rdquo; returned Jewel warmly. &ldquo;Error's using
      you, grandpa, not to love her. If we don't love people we can't be sure
      anything we do to them is right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham raised one hand and scratched his head slowly, regarding
      Jewel with what she felt was intended to be a humorous air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn't you give me an easier one?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh grandpa,&rdquo; the flaxen head nestled against his breast and the child
      sighed. &ldquo;I wish everybody knew how kind you are,&rdquo; and the broker patted
      her shoulder and enjoyed the clinging pressure of her cheek, for it
      assured him that again he stood firmly on the pedestal.

      CHAPTER XVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ESSEX MAID
    </h3>
    <p>
      The rain and wind lasted for three days, clearing at last on an evening
      which proved eventful.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham had taken a long ride into the country roundabout, and Jewel
      had been down at the gate to greet his return. He swung her up into the
      saddle with him, and in triumph she rode to the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham observed this from the window and reported to Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't suppose father would be so indulgent to any living thing as he
      is to that child,&rdquo; she said rather dejectedly. &ldquo;Do you know, Eloise, Mrs.
      Forbes says that Jewel spends every evening with him in his study.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? I'm not surprised. He had to take pity on her since we would
      not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham sighed. &ldquo;I really believe nobody was ever so exasperating
      as you are,&rdquo; she returned. &ldquo;When Jewel first came, if you remember, I
      wished to welcome her,&mdash;in fact I did,&mdash;but you refused to be
      decently civil. Now you speak as if we had made a mistake, and that it was
      my fault. I wish you would let Dr. Ballard prescribe for you. I don't
      think you are well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He does prescribe roses and chocolates, and I take them, don't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and after this you can have some golf. It will do you good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To-day was the third during which Eloise had helped her cousin with the
      morning lesson and brushed and braided her hair. Jewel had had many minds
      about whether to tell Eloise of her escaped secret. An intuition bade her
      refrain, but the sense of dishonesty was more than the child could bear;
      so that morning, during the hair braiding, she had confessed. She began
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wrote to my father and mother last night how good you were to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you tell them how good you were to me?&rdquo; asked the girl, so kindly
      that the child's heart leaped within her and she more than ever wished
      that she had nothing to confess.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I could be, cousin Eloise; I meant to be, but error crept in.&rdquo; The
      girl was learning something of the new phraseology, and she smiled at
      Jewel in the glass and was surprised to find what troubled eyes met hers.
      &ldquo;I went to sleep that night waiting for grandpa to be through with his
      book, and when I waked up he had read my letter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's smile faded. &ldquo;Tell me again what you said in it,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's lips quivered. &ldquo;I said how kind you were, and washed my hair, and
      asked me not to tell grandpa&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You put that in?&rdquo; Eloise interrupted eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child took courage from her changed tone. &ldquo;Yes; I said you didn't want
      him to know you were kind to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled slightly and went on with her brushing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wished he hadn't read it when he saw how sorry I was. He asked my
      pardon and said he had done bad form. I don't know what that is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the worst thing that can happen to some people,&rdquo; returned Eloise.
      &ldquo;Good form is said to be the New York conscience.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; responded Jewel, not understanding, but too relieved and grateful
      that her cousin was not unforgiving to press the matter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise fell into thought. Mr. Evringham had certainly been more genial at
      table, conversation had been more general and sustained last evening than
      ever before the advent of Jewel, and he had not sneered, either. Eloise
      searched her memory for some word or look that might have given hurt to
      her self-esteem, but she could find none.
    </p>
    <p>
      On this evening Mr. Evringham was in unusual spirits at dinner time. He
      told of the pleasure of Essex Maid at finding herself free of the stable
      again, and of the gallop he had taken among the hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meat course had just been removed when Sarah came in with a troubled
      face, saying that Zeke wanted to see Mr. Evringham. Something was the
      matter with Essex Maid. She seemed &ldquo;very bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The master's face changed, and he moved back from the table. The
      countenances of the others showed consternation. Mrs. Forbes turned pale.
      Had Zeke done anything, or left something undone? She dropped her tray and
      hastened after Mr. Evringham. Eloise noticed that Jewel's eyes were
      closed. In a minute the child pushed back from the table, and without a
      word to the others she hurried to the scene of trouble. She met Mrs.
      Forbes rushing to the kitchen for hot water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go straight into the house, Jewel,&rdquo; cried the housekeeper with an anger
      born of her excitement. &ldquo;Don't you go near that barn and get in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child, scarcely hearing her, fled on. As she entered the barn she
      heard her grandfather's voice addressing Zeke, who was flinging a saddle
      on Dick.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Busby'll leave anything when he knows it's the Maid.&rdquo; He didn't need
      to say &ldquo;hurry.&rdquo; Zeke was as anxious as his master to get the veterinary
      surgeon.
    </p>
    <p>
      Essex Maid had fallen in her stall and was making her misery apparent,
      tossing her head and rolling her eyes. Her master's teeth were set.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, may I try to help?&rdquo; came Jewel's eager voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go away, child,&rdquo; sternly. &ldquo;You'll get hurt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But may I treat her?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do anything,&rdquo; brusquely; &ldquo;but don't come near.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel ran to the back of the barn, dropped on the floor, and buried her
      face in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five minutes passed, ten, fifteen. Zeke rode up to the barn door, white
      and wild-eyed in the twilight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dr. Busby was away!&rdquo; he gasped. &ldquo;They tried to get him on the telephone,
      and at last did. He'll be here in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The Maid's better,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham, wiping his forehead. &ldquo;There
      hasn't been a repetition of the attack.&rdquo; Mrs. Forbes stood by, fanning
      herself with her apron. The mare was standing quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great Scott, but I'm glad!&rdquo; replied Zeke devoutly. &ldquo;I've seen 'em keel up
      with that. You can go through me with a fine tooth comb, Mr. Evringham,
      and you won't find a thing I've neglected for that mare.&rdquo; Excitement had
      placed the young fellow beyond his awe for the master.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, boy,&rdquo; returned the broker. In his relief he would have
      believed anything.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See the poor kid,&rdquo; said Zeke, catching sight of the little figure sitting
      out of earshot, where the twilight touched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham wheeled and strode back to the child. Her face was still
      hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't cry, Jewel,&rdquo; he said kindly, his voice unsteady. &ldquo;She's better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked up radiantly. &ldquo;I knew it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The unexpected look and exclamation startled her grandfather. &ldquo;Zeke says
      the doctor can't get here for a little while,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;but the mare
      is out of pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all right,&rdquo; rejoined the child joyously. &ldquo;The doctor ought not to
      come. We shall do better without him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The first gleam of her meaning began to shine across the broker's mind. He
      stared down at the little figure, uncertain whether to laugh or cry,
      sufficiently shaken to do either.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you midget you,&rdquo; he said, picking the child up in his arms; &ldquo;have
      you been trying your tricks over here in the corner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't the way to talk, grandpa, when God has helped us so,&rdquo; returned
      Jewel earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeke, following his employer, had heard this colloquy, and stared open
      mouthed.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Busby arrived he was a much injured man. &ldquo;The mare's perfectly
      fit,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;You've made me leave an important case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very sorry,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham, trying to look so. &ldquo;The fact is the
      Maid has given us a scare in the last hour that I shouldn't like repeated.
      Look her over carefully, Busby, carefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have.&rdquo; The veterinary gave a cross look around the group, his glance
      resting a moment on the upturned face of a little flaxen-haired girl who
      stood with her hand in Mr. Evringham's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's falling into his dotage, I guess,&rdquo; said the doctor privately to
      Zeke, as he prepared to ride away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't fool yourself,&rdquo; returned the young fellow. &ldquo;The mare pretty near
      scared me into a fit. My knees ain't real steady yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood watching the disappearing figure of the veterinary. &ldquo;That kid
      believes praying did it,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;I ain't going to believe that, of
      course, but the whole thing was the queerest ever.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, after one more visit to the stall of Essex Maid, started
      back to the house, Jewel skipping beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes remained in the barn, one hand still pressed to her ample
      bosom, a teakettle in the other.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What'd you calc'late to do, ma?&rdquo; inquired her son, approaching her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wring out hot flannels. It's sense to treat colic the same, whether it's
      in a horse or a baby.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke laughed. &ldquo;Essex Maid didn't think so, did she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't let us do a thing. I saw the tears drip out of Mr. Evringham's
      eyes plain as I see you now. Zeke Forbes, you'll never know what it was to
      me to have you come in and speak the way you did. You couldn't have done
      it if you'd mistreated the horse any way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; returned the coachman emphatically. &ldquo;I ain't monkeying with
      buzz saws this year.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not knowingly you wouldn't. But, child,&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Forbes set down the
      kettle and pressed the other hand tighter to her bosom as she came closer
      to him, &ldquo;last night you'd been drinking when you came home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho!&rdquo; laughed Zeke uncomfortably, &ldquo;just a smile or two with the boys. By
      ginger, you've got a nose on you, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you think of your father and then laugh over it, Zeke? There hasn't a
      man ever come to be a sot that didn't laugh about it in the first place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mother, now, now,&rdquo; said the young fellow in half-impatient tones of
      consolation, as he took the handkerchief from her apron pocket and wiped
      her eyes, where tears began to spring. &ldquo;You must trust a chap to do what's
      right. I ain't a fool. Don't you think about this again. I can take care
      of myself. Come now, to change the subject, what's your opinion of
      Christian Science as applied to horses with the colic?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; returned the housekeeper in an unusually subdued tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, didn't you catch on? The kid was over there in the corner treating
      the Maid. That's what they call it, treating 'em. Mr. Evringham laughed
      when he found out, and she jumped on him. Yes, she did; came right out and
      told him that wasn't the way to show his gratitude, or something like
      that. Think of the nerve!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't surprised. That child can't surprise me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But what do you think of it, ma? I tell you 't was queer, the way that
      mare's pain stopped. Of course I ain't going to believe&mdash;but,&rdquo;
       firmly, &ldquo;I can't get away from a notion that those Christian Science folks
      know something that we don't. Busby was madder'n a hornet. I didn't
      scarcely know what to say to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be soft, Zeke,&rdquo; returned his mother, picking up the kettle. &ldquo;The
      time for superstition has gone by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Jewel and her grandfather entered the house they heard music.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's cousin Eloise playing. Have you heard her grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, when they first came.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Than you haven't sat with them in the evening for a long time?&rdquo; suggested
      the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. I&mdash;I didn't wish to monopolize their society. I wanted to give
      Dr. Ballard a chance. He is a friend of theirs, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I think cousin Eloise would be glad if she thought you liked her
      playing. It's very beautiful, isn't it, grandpa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I dare say. Then, besides, I'm not at all sure that Mrs. Evringham
      would permit me to smoke in the drawing-room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But wouldn't it be nice to go in there just a few minutes before you go
      to your study? I love to hear cousin Eloise play, but I like to be with
      you, grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham was in a yielding state of mind. He allowed the pressure of
      the child's hand on his to lead him to the drawing-room, where his
      entrance made a little stir.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard was sitting near the piano, listening to the music. Everybody
      rose as the newcomers entered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Ballard? Jewel wished to hear her cousin's music, and so
      behold us. If we bring a reminder of the stable, blame her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh father, that dear horse is all right, I'm sure,&rdquo; gushed Mrs.
      Evringham, &ldquo;or else you wouldn't be here!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? Something the matter with Essex Maid?&rdquo; asked Dr. Ballard with
      concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham seated himself. &ldquo;A sharp attack, but short. She was
      relieved before we could get Busby here.&rdquo; The speaker contracted his
      eyebrows and looked at the child, who was still beside him. &ldquo;The mare had
      received mental treatments meanwhile,&rdquo; he added gravely.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard smiled, and drawing Jewel to him, lifted her upon his knee.
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;can't you let anything around here be sick in
      peace? We doctors shall have to form a union and manage to get you
      boycotted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child smiled back at him, her head a little on one side, as her manner
      was when she was in doubt how to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a blessing!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham vivaciously. &ldquo;Here, father, is
      the best cup of coffee you ever drank, if I did make it myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Many weeks had elapsed since the broker had accepted a cup of coffee from
      that fair hand, but he rose now to take it with good grace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there going to be some cambric tea for this baby?&rdquo; inquired Dr.
      Ballard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must be hungry, Jewel; you hadn't finished your dinner,&rdquo; said her
      grandfather, but she protested that she was not.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How is Anna Belle?&rdquo; asked Dr. Ballard. &ldquo;It's a long time since I saw
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you like to?&rdquo; asked Jewel doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;of&mdash;course!&mdash;if she's still up. Don't have her dress
      on my account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She doesn't go to bed till I do,&rdquo; responded the child. &ldquo;I know she'd love
      to come down!&rdquo; In a flash she had bounded to the door and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was still sitting on the piano stool, facing the room.
      &ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; she said, leaning slightly forward in her earnestness, &ldquo;did
      Jewel really treat Essex Maid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker shrugged his shoulders and smiled as he stirred his coffee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you think it did the horse any good?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be absurd!&rdquo; cried her mother laughingly, on nettles lest the girl
      displease the young doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't crowd me, Eloise, don't crowd me,&rdquo; responded Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;I'd
      rather have something a little more substantial doing for a sick horse
      than the prayers of an infant; eh, Ballard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been reading Jewel's Christian Science book a great deal the last
      few days,&rdquo; said Eloise. &ldquo;If it's the truth, then she helped Essex Maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham was dismayed. &ldquo;What a very large <i>if</i>, my dear,&rdquo; she
      returned lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a bright little girl,&rdquo; said Dr. Ballard, and as he spoke Jewel came
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      She brought her doll straight to him, and he took both child and doll on
      his lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear fellow,&rdquo; thought Mrs. Evringham, &ldquo;how fond he is of children! I'd
      like to put Eloise in a strait-jacket. Do play some more, dear, won't
      you?&rdquo; she said aloud, eager to return to safe ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; added Jewel ardently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you will sing afterward. Will you?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Can you sing, Jewel?&rdquo; asked Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, grandpa, nothing but the tunes in church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he responded, half smiling again, &ldquo;I don't know that a hymn would
      be so out of place to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do play the lovely running thing about spring, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; begged the
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl turned back to the piano. &ldquo;Jewel is so modern that she doesn't
      know the Mendelssohn 'Spring Song,'&rdquo; she said, and forthwith she began it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's head lay back against Dr. Ballard's shoulder, and her eyes never
      swerved from the white-robed musician.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the player had finished and been thanked, the child and the doctor
      exchanged a look of appreciation. &ldquo;That sounds the way it does in the
      Ravine of Happiness,&rdquo; said Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the brook is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Dr. Ballard had unpleasant associations with the brook. &ldquo;I
      understand you are fond of horses,&rdquo; he added irrelevantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to go driving with me to-morrow morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's face grew radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo; She looked across at her grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised to take you driving, didn't I, Jewel? Well, the pleasant
      weather has come. I guess she'll go with me to-morrow, Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Guess again, Mr. Evringham,&rdquo; retorted the doctor gayly. &ldquo;She has accepted
      my invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked on and wondered. &ldquo;What is it about that child that
      takes them all?&rdquo; she soliloquized. &ldquo;She reminds me of that dreadfully
      plain Madam what's-her-name, who was so fascinating to everybody at the
      French court.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was smiling. &ldquo;Now it's your turn, Jewel,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child looked from one to another. &ldquo;I never sang for anybody,&rdquo; she
      returned doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed, for Anna Belle. I've heard you,&rdquo; said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she was singing with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well. Let her sing with you now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The one I heard,&mdash;'Father, where Thine own children are I love to
      be.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean. 'O'er waiting harpstrings.' All right,&rdquo; and the child,
      sitting where she was, sang the well-loved hymn to a touched audience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word, Jewel,&rdquo; said her grandfather when she had finished. &ldquo;Your
      music isn't all in your soul.&rdquo; His eyes were glistening.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Those are beautiful words,&rdquo; said Dr. Ballard. &ldquo;I don't remember any such
      hymn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Eddy wrote it,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't Castle Discord to-night,&rdquo; she said later to Anna Belle, while
      they were going to bed. &ldquo;Didn't you notice how much differently people
      loved one another?&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XIX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A MORNING DRIVE
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare, Eloise,&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham the next morning, &ldquo;it is almost
      worth three whole days of storm to have a spell of such heavenly weather
      to follow. We're sure of several days like this now,&rdquo; She was standing at
      the open window, having shown a surprising energy in rising soon after
      breakfast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced over her shoulder at her daughter, who was picking up the
      garments strewn about the room. &ldquo;Now you can live out of doors, I hope,
      and get yourself toned up again. Really, last evening things were very
      comfortable, weren't they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I thought the lump had begun to be leavened,&rdquo; returned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Talk English, please,&rdquo; said her mother vivaciously. &ldquo;Father seemed quite
      human, and that is all we have ever needed to make things tolerable here.
      I suppose we reaped the benefit of his relief about the horse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all Jewel,&rdquo; said Eloise, smiling. &ldquo;That's English, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel!&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham exclaimed. &ldquo;Why, you're all daffy about that
      child. What <i>is</i> the attraction?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I'm trying to find out. It's time for me to go up now and
      braid her hair and read the lesson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham regarded her daughter. &ldquo;Young people are eager for novelty,
      I know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and it would seem as if an interest in a child was an
      innocent diversion for you at a time when you were growing morbid, but I
      do think I'm the most unlucky woman in the world! To think that the child
      should have to be a Christian Scientist, and that you should take this
      perverse interest in her ideas just now. I haven't spoken of your remarks
      about the horse last night, but it was in poor taste, to say the least, to
      mention such nonsense before Dr. Ballard, and apparently do it so
      seriously. I knew you had been helping Jewel with lessons, but until last
      evening I didn't suspect that it might all be on that odious subject. Is
      it, Eloise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but it isn't odious. I like the fruit of it in her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've never shown Dr. Ballard your most agreeable side, and now if
      you're going to parade before him, an Episcopalian and a physician, an
      interest in this&mdash;anarchism, I shan't blame him in the smallest
      degree if he gives up all thought of you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise, the undemonstrative, put an arm around her mother. &ldquo;Shan't you,
      really?&rdquo; she replied wistfully. &ldquo;If I could only hope that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want to give me nervous prostration?&rdquo; rejoined Mrs. Evringham
      sharply. &ldquo;Eloise,&rdquo; her voice suddenly breaking, &ldquo;do you love to torment
      me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I don't, poor mother, but I've been so tormented myself, and so
      desirous not to&mdash;oh, not to do anything ignoble! I can't tell you all
      I've endured since&mdash;&rdquo; She paused, her lips unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Since we lost your father,&rdquo; dismally. &ldquo;Yes, I know it. I'm the most
      unlucky woman in the world!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's arm tightened about her mother as she went on, &ldquo;Since I was
      enchanted and thrown into Castle Discord.&rdquo; She looked off at the mental
      picture of her cousin. &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; she turned back suddenly, &ldquo;what a
      wonderful thing it is if there really is a God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Eloise Evringham, have you ever doubted it! That's positively
      ill-bred!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But One that would be any good to us! Jewel's mother thinks she knows
      such a One, and so does the child. I wish you'd look into this Christian
      Science with me. You might find it better than getting grandfather to pay
      our bills, better than marrying me to Dr. Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham raised her eyes to her deity. &ldquo;What have I ever done,&rdquo; she
      ejaculated, &ldquo;that I should have a queer child! Well, I will not look into
      it,&rdquo; she returned decidedly; &ldquo;and if Dr. Ballard were not the broad, noble
      type of man that he is, he wouldn't take the trouble to notice and
      entertain a child who has treated him as she has. It might touch even you
      to see the lengths to which he goes to please you. I hope you will at
      least have the grace to go down with Jewel to the buggy and see them off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't in this wrapper,&rdquo; replied Eloise, releasing the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not, so put on a dress before you go up to Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's too late, dear. He'll be here by half-past ten. I must have her
      ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked after her daughter's retreating figure, and then her
      lips came together firmly. She untied the ribbons of the loose gown of
      lace and silk, in which she had keyed herself up by degrees to face the
      requirements of luncheon and the afternoon's diversions, and donned a
      conventional dress, in which she composed herself by the window to watch
      for the doctor's buggy. There was a vista in the park avenue which
      afforded a fair look at equipages three minutes before they could reach
      Mr. Evringham's gateway.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the moment the doctor's office hour was over this stanch supporter
      set herself to watch that gap. As soon as she saw Hector's dappled coat
      and easy stride she sprang up and went downstairs, and when the shining
      buggy paused at the steps and Dr. Ballard jumped out, she appeared on the
      piazza to greet him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What an inspiring morning!&rdquo; she said, as he removed his hat. &ldquo;That insane
      girl!&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;If he had chanced to be awkward and plain, he would
      have been just as important to us. His good looks are thrown in, and yet
      she won't behave herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Glorious indeed!&rdquo; he replied heartily. &ldquo;Where's my young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham had plenty of worldly experience, and not even her enemies
      called her stupid, but at this moment there was but one young lady in the
      world to her, as she believed there was to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She is upstairs braiding Jewel's hair,&rdquo; she replied before she realized
      her own insanity. Then she hastened on, coloring under the odd look in his
      eyes, &ldquo;But you mean Jewel, of course. She will be down at once, I'm sure.
      It's so kind of you to take her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. She's an original worth cultivating.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I suppose she must be, since you
      all say so. Eloise gives up a surprising amount of time to her, but I
      can't judge much from that, because Eloise is so unselfish. For my part,
      the child's ideas are so strange, and my little girl is still so young and
      impressionable, I object to having them much together. It may seem very
      absurd, when Jewel is so young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I saw last evening how interested Miss Eloise already is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; hastily, &ldquo;she pretends to be, and I assure you I object. Eloise has
      a good mind, and I hope you will offer a little antidote now and then to
      the stuff she has begun to read. A word to the wise, Dr. Ballard. I need
      say no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was true. Mrs. Evringham had no need to say more. Her ideas, and
      especially those which related to himself, had always been inscribed in
      large characters and words of one syllable for her present companion, who
      was a young man of considerable perception and discrimination.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not time to reply before Jewel, radiant of face, appeared in the
      doorway, where she hesitated, her doll in her arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I brought Anna Belle,&rdquo; she said doubtfully, &ldquo;but I can leave her under
      the stairs if there isn't room.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anna Belle under the stairs on a morning like this! And in such a toilet?
      Talk about error!&rdquo; The doctor's tone was tragic as he lifted the happy
      child into the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham nodded a reply to their smiling farewells as Hector sprang
      forward, and she looked after them in some perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why should he take the trouble?&rdquo; she reflected. &ldquo;It would have been such
      a splendid morning for them to have gone riding if he had this leisure. Of
      course it must have been just one of his indirect and lovely ways of
      trying to please Eloise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Just as she was solacing herself with the latter reflection, her daughter
      stepped out on the piazza, a little black book in her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Warm enough to sit out, isn't it?&rdquo; she remarked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother looked at her critically. She had not seen this care-free look
      on her child's face since Lawrence died.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why didn't you come out a little sooner?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't presentable. How delicious the air is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Let us sit here and finish that novel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Eddy's book,&mdash;'Science and Health.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham made a grimace. &ldquo;I read part of it once. That was enough
      for me. Think of the price they charge for it, too. Think of pretending it
      is such a good thing for everybody to have, and then putting a price on it
      that prohibits the average pocketbook.&rdquo; Eloise's smile annoyed her mother.
      &ldquo;Weren't you with me the day Nat Bonnell's mother said so much about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How foolish she was not to try it,&rdquo; said Eloise. &ldquo;Such a hopeless,
      monotonous invalid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, some of her friends worked hard enough to induce her to, but when
      she found out the mercenary side of it, she saw at once that it couldn't
      be trustworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose even Christian Scientists must have a roof and food and
      clothes,&rdquo; returned Eloise coolly; &ldquo;but I've thought a good deal the last
      few days about the criticisms I've heard on the price of the book. The
      fuss over that three dollars is certainly very funny, when the average
      pocketbook goes to the theatre sometimes, has flowers for its
      entertainments, and rejoices to find lace reduced from a dollar and a
      quarter to ninety-five cents a yard for its gowns. It eagerly hoards and
      spends three dollars for some passing pleasure or effect, but winces and
      ponders over paying the same sum for a book that will last a lifetime, and
      which, if it is worth anything, furnishes the key to every problem in
      life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why isn't it as cheap as the Bible if it is so beneficial?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be, probably, when it is generally respected. For the present it
      wouldn't be wise to cast it about like pearls before swine.&rdquo; Eloise smiled
      at herself. &ldquo;You see I'm talking as if I knew it all. My wisdom comes
      partially from what I have extracted from Jewel, and partly from what is
      obvious. I haven't reached the place yet where I am convinced, but this
      book is wonderfully interesting. It came to me in the darkest hour I have
      ever known, and it has&mdash;it has seemed to feed me when I was starving.
      I don't know how else to put it. I can't think of anything else. Mother,
      why haven't we a Bible? I was ashamed when Jewel asked me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham, astonished and dismayed by her daughter's earnestness,
      drew herself up. &ldquo;We have a Bible, certainly. What an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is it?&rdquo; eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the storage warehouse with the other books.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's laugh nettled her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prayer books are upstairs on my table. What more do you want if you
      are going to take an interest in such things? I wish you would, dear, and
      embroider an altar cloth while you are here. I'm sure father would gladly
      contribute the materials and feel a pride in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh mother,&rdquo; Eloise still smiled, &ldquo;you know he never goes to church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he contributes largely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I haven't time to embroider altar cloths. Shall I get the story?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, do. We'll go around the corner, out of the wind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile Dr. Ballard's buggy was covering the ground rapidly. Through the
      avenues of the park sped Hector, and joy! Dr. Ballard allowed Jewel to
      drive as long as they remained within its precincts. Slipping his hand
      through the reins above where she grasped them, he held Anna Belle on his
      knee. Jewel had not suspected the size of the park. One could almost see
      the watered leaves increase in the sunshine, and the birds were swelling
      their little throats to the utmost. The roses in her cheeks deepened in
      her happy excitement. She allowed the doctor to do most of the talking,
      while she kept her eyes on the horse's ears. Just once she ventured to
      turn enough to glance at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've had dreams of driving horses,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is this the first time you've done it waking?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, the second. Father took me once in Washington Park just before he
      came away, but the horse didn't pull like this.&rdquo; She smiled seraphically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So, boy, steady,&rdquo; said the doctor soothingly, and Hector obeyed the
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you play in the Ravine of Happiness when you were a little boy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where the brook is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes. Are you planning to take me to that brook and wet my feet,
      Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've gone long past it. Don't you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think my education has been neglected. I don't remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can go,&rdquo; returned Jewel suggestively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, we will; but first I have a couple of visits I must make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The horse was now trotting toward the park gate. As they reached it Dr.
      Ballard returned Anna Belle and took the lines.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gave an unconscious sigh of rapture. &ldquo;Trolleys and so on, you know,&rdquo;
       explained Dr. Ballard. &ldquo;When you come back ten years from now you shall
      drive outside too. How was Essex Maid this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was all right, but grandpa took only a short ride. I guess he was a
      little&mdash;bit&mdash;afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's the apple of his eye, or he wouldn't have been so nervous over a
      trifle last evening,&rdquo; remarked the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she made a great fuss,&rdquo; replied Jewel. &ldquo;She fell down in her stall,
      and everything like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did she really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Zeke said his knees were shaking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But she was all right by the time Dr. Busby arrived?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard looked at his small companion, a quizzical smile curving his
      mustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've never thought of taking a partner, Jewel, but I might consider a
      mascot. What do you say to sharing my office and being my mascot? Special
      high chair for Anna Belle, be it well understood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl eyed him, her head on one side. It was her experience that
      all men were jokers. &ldquo;I don't know what a mascot is,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's something or somebody that brings one good luck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I could bring you good luck?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks that way. Of course there are certain rules you would have to
      observe. It wouldn't do for you to talk against materia medica to the
      patients in the anteroom.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is an anteroom?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The place where my patients wait until I can see them in my office.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel lifted her shoulders and smiled. &ldquo;I might read them 'Science and
      Health' while they waited, and then they wouldn't have to go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard's laugh rang heartily along the leafy street. &ldquo;Is that your
      idea of mascoting a poor young physician?&rdquo; he inquired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel laughed in sympathy. She didn't quite understand him, but she knew
      that they were having a very good time.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pretty soon her companion drove in at the gate of an imposing old
      residence, set back from the street where the trolley ran with an air of
      withdrawing from the intrusion of these modern tracks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought it wouldn't injure your conscience to wait for me while I made
      a couple of professional visits, Jewel, eh?&rdquo; he asked, as he jumped out
      and fastened Hector to the ring in the hand of a bronze boy. &ldquo;I won't be
      any longer than I can help, and don't you go to hoodooing me, now, while
      I'm upstairs.&rdquo; The doctor returned to the buggy and took the black case,
      frowning warningly at the child. &ldquo;I have troubles enough here without
      that. This old lady used to trot me on her knee, and she wants to spend
      half an hour every morning proving that doctors don't know anything before
      she'll let me get to business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It must be hard for doctors,&rdquo; returned Jewel, &ldquo;going to sorry people all
      the time, and nothing to give them except something on their tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard gave his small companion a quick glance. If he secretly
      considered her beliefs as too richly absurd to excite aught but amusement,
      she evidently as honestly compassionated the poverty of ideas in his
      learned profession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll hurry,&rdquo; he said, and vanished within the house. Time would not
      have dragged for Jewel had he stayed all the morning. To sit in the
      shining buggy in close proximity to the dappled gray Hector, and with Anna
      Belle for a sympathizer, caused the minutes to be winged.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the doctor returned, a radiant face welcomed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I should never get away,&rdquo; he sighed, &ldquo;but you don't look
      bored.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He untied the horse, jumped into the buggy, and they were off again,
      Hector striding along as if to make up for lost time. &ldquo;Now only one more
      call, Jewel, and then we'll get back out of the dust again,&rdquo; said the
      doctor cheerily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't noticed any dust, Dr. Ballard. I'm having the most <i>fun</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well now, I'm glad of that. It's a great thing to be eight years old,
      Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what cousin Eloise says. She says she'd like to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? How is the enchanting&mdash;excuse me&mdash;I mean the enchanted
      maiden this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's well. She ties my bows now, so grandpa doesn't have to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ties your&mdash;&rdquo; The doctor looked at the speaker, mystified.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel put her hand up to the small billows of silk behind her ear. &ldquo;My
      hair bows. They were real hard for grandpa to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard repressed a guffaw, and then turned solemn. &ldquo;Do you mean to
      say that Mr. Evringham tied your hair ribbons?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That settles it, Jewel. You must go into partnership with me and wave
      wands and things. Setting Essex Maid on her legs wasn't a patch on that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel regarded him questioningly a moment and then repeated, &ldquo;But it was
      real hard for grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And cousin Eloise is the kindest girl. She's like grandpa about that. Her
      kindness is inside, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it indeed? You don't know how much I thank you for telling me where to
      look for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she must be kind to <i>you</i>, Dr. Ballard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Once in a while, once in a while,&rdquo; he replied cautiously, but Jewel
      couldn't get a look into his eyes, though she tried, he was so busily
      engaged poking an invisible fly from Hector's side with the point of the
      whip. &ldquo;If you'll find a way to make her kind to me all the time, Jewel,
      then you will be my mascot indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All you have to do is to know she is,&rdquo; replied the child earnestly. &ldquo;I
      felt the way you do, at first, but now I've found out just because I
      stopped being afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that's the recipe, eh? All I've to do is to stop being afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all!&rdquo; cried Jewel, beaming at his ready comprehension. &ldquo;You'll
      find out there isn't a thing to be afraid of with Cousin Eloise, and oh,
      Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; the child smiled at him wistfully, &ldquo;she's getting so&mdash;so&mdash;unenchanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You just waved your wand, I suppose, and said 'Presto change,'&rdquo; returned
      the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      He turned Hector down a side street and drew rein under a large elm.
      &ldquo;Here's my rheumatic gentleman,&rdquo; he added, as he jumped from the buggy and
      fastened the horse. &ldquo;He won't keep me waiting while he abuses doctors, so
      I shan't be quite so long this time.&rdquo; The speaker seized his case and went
      up a garden path to the house, and Jewel, with a luxurious sigh, set Anna
      Belle in the place he had vacated.

      CHAPTER XX
    </h2>
    <h3>
      BY THE BROOKSIDE
    </h3>
    <p>
      Scarcely had she seen the doctor admitted and the house door closed when
      an approaching pedestrian caught her eye. She recognized him at once, and
      a little more color stole into her round cheeks, while an unconscious
      smile touched her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The gentleman had observed the doctor enter the house, and glanced idly as
      he passed, to see what child was waiting in the buggy. The half shy look
      of recognition which he met surprised him. Somewhere he had seen that rosy
      face. Going on his way and searching his memory he had left the buggy
      behind, when in a flash it came to him how, one day, that same shy,
      pleased smile had beamed wistfully upon him in a trolley car.
    </p>
    <p>
      Instantly he turned back, and in a minute Jewel saw him standing beside
      her. He lifted his hat and replaced it as he held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We've met before, haven't we?&rdquo; he asked kindly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel shook hands with him, much pleased. &ldquo;My mother and father have gone
      to Europe,&rdquo; she said &ldquo;and it seemed as if there wasn't a Scientist in the
      whole world until I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another proof of what I always say&mdash;that we should all wear the pin.
      I didn't know that Dr. Ballard had any Science relations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Dr. Ballard and I are not relations,&rdquo; explained Jewel seriously. &ldquo;I
      think he wants to marry my cousin Eloise; but he hasn't ever said so, and
      I don't like to ask him. He's the kindest man. I just love him, and he's
      letting me ride around with him while he makes calls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's very nice, I'm sure,&rdquo; returned Mr. Reeves, smiling broadly.
      &ldquo;Does he know that you're a Christian Scientist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, indeed. I had a claim, and my grandpa called him to help me, so
      then I told him, but he kept on reflecting love just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reeves scented an interesting experience, but he would not question
      the child. &ldquo;Nice fellow, Guy Ballard. He deserves a better fate than to
      bow down to false gods all his days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned Jewel heartily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, as you say,&rdquo; continued Mr. Reeves, &ldquo;he reflects love, and so we
      shall hear of his being a successful physician.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want him to be always happy,&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is your grandfather, my dear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Evringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible? Then you are&mdash;whose child?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father's name is Harry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, of course.&rdquo; Mr. Reeves nodded, trying to conceal his surprise.
      &ldquo;And is he a Scientist now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, my mother is teaching him to be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sure I'm very glad to hear this. Your grandfather is not
      unkindly disposed toward Science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My grandfather couldn't be unkind to anything! I thought you knew him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reeves smoothed his mustache vigorously. &ldquo;I thought I did,&rdquo; he
      returned. &ldquo;You spoke of your cousin. I knew your aunt and cousin were with
      Mr. Evringham now. Well, I'm glad, I'm sure, that you are so pleasantly
      situated. You must come to our little hall some Sunday where we have
      service, you know. It will be rather different from your beautiful
      churches in Chicago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'd love to come,&rdquo; replied the child eagerly. &ldquo;I didn't know there
      was one here. I'll get grandpa to bring me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Evringham!&rdquo; The speaker could feel the tendency of his jaw to drop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, or else cousin Eloise. She helps me get the lesson every day, and
      then she takes my book and reads and reads. She told me this morning she
      read almost all last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reeves nodded slowly once or twice. &ldquo;Still they come,&rdquo; he murmured
      meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you&mdash;would you mind writing down where that hall is?&rdquo; asked
      the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly I will.&rdquo; Mr. Reeves suited the action to the word, taking an
      envelope from his pocket for the purpose. &ldquo;And if I ever see Mr. Evringham
      there&rdquo;&mdash;he said slowly, &ldquo;by the way, please tell your grandfather
      that we met and had this chat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know your name,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course. Pardon me. Reeves. Mr. Reeves. Can you remember that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl flashed a bright look at him. &ldquo;We can't forget,&rdquo; she
      reminded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; he nodded. &ldquo;Exactly. I'm very likely younger in Science than
      you are, little one. How long have you known about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel thought. &ldquo;Seven years,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion gave a laughing exclamation. &ldquo;There, you see. I've known for
      only one year. What is your name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel Evringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Jewel, till we meet again, some Sunday soon, I hope.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They shook hands, and Mr. Reeves went smiling on his way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Seven years,&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;There's the simon pure article. She can't be
      over nine. I'll wager Bel-Air Park has had its sensations of late.
      Evringham! The high ball, the billiard ball, and the race track, and now
      the reputation of being a difficult old martinet. Never unkind to
      anything! Why, she's a little feminine Siegfried, that precious Jewel.
      Ballard and the cousin, eh? I've heard that rumor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Dr. Ballard returned to the buggy, Jewel began loquaciously telling
      him of her pleasant experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he knows you, Mr. Reeves does, and he said you were a nice fellow,&rdquo;
       she finished, beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very civil of him, I'm sure,&rdquo; returned the doctor as the horse started.
      &ldquo;I distinctly remember his having a different opinion one night when he
      caught me in his favorite cherry tree; but I don't yet understand the
      levity of his behavior in scraping acquaintance with the young lady I left
      unprotected in my buggy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we'd met before in a trolley car,&rdquo; explained Jewel. &ldquo;I wanted to run
      right to him when I first saw that he was a Scientist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what? Mr. Reeves? Oh, go 'way, my little mascot. Go 'way!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he had on the pin&mdash;this one, you know.&rdquo; Jewel touched the small
      gold symbol, and Dr. Ballard examined it curiously. &ldquo;So we smiled at each
      other, and to-day he's told me where I can come to church, and I'm nearly
      sure cousin Eloise will go with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard's eyes grew serious as he turned Hector's head toward the
      park. &ldquo;I can scarcely believe it of Mr. Reeves,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says you are too nice to bow down to false gods,&rdquo; added Jewel shyly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If mine are false to you, yours are false to me,&rdquo; said the young man
      kindly. &ldquo;You can understand that, can't you, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And we should never quarrel over it, should we?&rdquo; he went on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o!&rdquo; returned Jewel scornfully. &ldquo;We'd get a pain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you can see,&rdquo; went on the young doctor seriously, &ldquo;that the more we
      cared for one another the more we should regret such a wide difference of
      opinion.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; agreed the child, &ldquo;and so we'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are going back to Chicago after a while, and so you understand that I
      can better afford to agree to differ with you than I could with some one
      who was going to stay here&mdash;your cousin Eloise, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked at him in silence. She had never seen Dr. Ballard wear
      this expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;For this reason, Jewel, I want to ask you if you won't do me the favor
      not to talk to your cousin about Christian Science, nor ask her to read
      your books, nor to go to church with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's countenance reflected his seriousness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can see, can't you, that if Miss Eloise should become much interested
      in that fad it would spoil our pleasure in being together, while it
      lasted?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The word fad was not in Jewel's vocabulary, but she grasped the doctor's
      meaning, and understood that he was much in earnest. She felt very
      responsible for the moment, and in doubt how to express herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel sort of mixed up, Dr. Ballard,&rdquo; she returned after a minute's
      silent perplexity. &ldquo;You don't mind cousin Eloise reading the Bible, do
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're glad if she can be happy instead of sorry, aren't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked at him hopefully. &ldquo;There won't be anything worse than that,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, many things worse,&rdquo; he responded quickly. &ldquo;You might do me that
      little favor, Jewel. I understand you go to her with your lessons, as you
      call it, and your questions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she helps me; but she takes my books to her room. I don't see how I
      can help it, Dr. Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he heaved a quiet sigh, &ldquo;perhaps the attack will be shorter if it
      is sharp. We'll hope so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't do any harm to you for anything,&rdquo; said the child earnestly,
      &ldquo;but you wait a little while. When people come into Christian Science it
      makes them twice as nice. If you see cousin Eloise get twice as nice
      you'll be glad, won't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man gave an impatient half laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not grasping,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;She does very well for me as she is.
      Now,&rdquo; he turned again to the child, who rejoiced in the recovered twinkle
      in his eyes, &ldquo;you have my full permission to convert the error fairy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, hush!&rdquo; ejaculated Jewel, alarmed. &ldquo;We mustn't hold that law over
      her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Convert her, I say. Let us see what she would be like if she were twice
      as nice. She's a very charming woman now, your aunt Madge. If she were
      twice as nice&mdash;who knows? The fairy might spread wings and float
      away!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had entered the park and Jewel suddenly noted their surroundings.
      &ldquo;We're coming to the Ravine of Happiness,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way it's been looking to me ever since last evening,&rdquo;
       responded her companion meditatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child paid no attention to his words. She was watching eagerly for the
      bend in the road beside which the gorge lay steepest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said at last, resting her hand on that of her companion.
      Obediently the doctor stopped his horse. The park was still but for the
      bird notes, the laughter and babble of the brook far below, and the rustle
      of the fresh leaves, each one a transparency for a sunbeam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two were silent for a minute, Jewel's radiant eyes seeking the pensive
      ones of her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you hear?&rdquo; she asked softly at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is cousin Eloise's Spring Song.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The doctor's words and looks remained in Jewel's mind after she reached
      home that day. She mused concerning him while she was taking off Anna
      Belle's hat and jacket up in her own room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't suppose you could understand much what he meant, dearie,&rdquo; she
      said, her face very sober from stress of thought, &ldquo;but I did. If I'd been
      as big as mother I could have helped him; but I knew I was too little, and
      when people don't understand, mother says it is so easy to make mistakes
      in what you say to them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna Belle's silence gave assent, and her sweet expression was always a
      solace to Jewel, who kissed the hard roses in her cheeks repeatedly before
      she sat her in the big chair by the window and went down to lunch. Anna
      Belle's forced abstemiousness had ceased to afflict her. At the lunch
      table she gave a vivacious account of the morning's diversions, and for
      once Mrs. Evringham listened to what she said, a curious expression on her
      face. This lady had expected to endure annoyance with this child on her
      grandfather's account; but for unkind fate to cause Jewel to be a
      hindrance and a marplot in the case of Dr. Ballard was adding insult to
      injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child, suddenly catching the expression of Mrs. Evringham's eyes as
      they rested upon her, was startled, and ceased talking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aunt Madge does love me,&rdquo; she declared mentally. &ldquo;God's children love one
      another every minute, every minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So Mr. Reeves told you where you can go to church,&rdquo; said Eloise, replying
      to Jewel's last bit of information.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and&rdquo;&mdash;the little girl was going on eagerly to suggest that her
      cousin accompany her, when suddenly Dr. Ballard's eyes seemed looking at
      her and repeating their protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      She stopped, and ate for a time in silence. Mrs. Forbes paid little
      attention to what was being said. She moved about perfunctorily, with an
      air of preoccupation. She had a more serious trouble now than the care and
      intrusion of the belongings of Lawrence and Harry Evringham, a worry that
      for days and nights had not ceased to gnaw at her heart, first as a
      suspicion and afterward as a certainty.
    </p>
    <p>
      When luncheon was over, Eloise in leaving the dining-room, put her arm
      around Jewel's shoulders, and together they strolled through the hall and
      out upon the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked after them. &ldquo;If only that child weren't a little
      fanatic and Eloise in such an erratic, wayward state, ready to seize upon
      anything novel, it would be all very well,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;for Dr. Ballard
      seems to find Jewel amusing, and it might be a point of common interest.
      As it is, if ever I wished any one in Jericho, it's that child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel, happy in the proximity of her lovely cousin, satisfied herself by a
      glance that aunt Madge was not following.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise looked about over the sunny, verdant landscape. &ldquo;What a deceitful
      world,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It looks so serene and easy to live in. So it was very
      lovely over at your ravine this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Jewel looked up at her with eager eyes. &ldquo;Let's go. You haven't been
      there. It's only a little way. You don't need your hat, cousin Eloise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Summer was in the air. The girl was amused at the child's enthusiastic
      tone. &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel drew her on with an embracing arm, and they descended the steps and
      walked down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly the child stopped. &ldquo;Doesn't it seem unkind to go without Anna
      Belle!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, nonsense,&rdquo; returned Eloise, smiling. &ldquo;You're not going way upstairs
      to get her. We needn't tell her we went. She's been out driving all the
      morning. I think it's my turn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked happily up into her cousin's face. &ldquo;I love to see you
      laugh, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; she returned, and they strolled on.
    </p>
    <p>
      The park drives were deserted. The cousins reached the gorge without
      meeting any one. Leaning upon the slender fence, they gazed down into the
      green depths, and for a minute listened to the woodland melody.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't it just like your Spring Song?&rdquo; asked the child at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is sweet and comforting and good,&rdquo; replied the girl slowly, a far-off
      look in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel lifted her shoulders. &ldquo;Don't you want to get down there, cousin
      Eloise?&rdquo; she asked, her eyes sparkling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; replied the girl promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it hurt your dress?&rdquo; added Jewel, with a sudden memory of Mrs.
      Forbes, as she looked over her cousin's immaculate black and white
      costume.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess not,&rdquo; laughed the girl. &ldquo;Are you afraid Mrs. Forbes will put me
      to bed?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She bent her lithe figure and was under the wire in a twinkling. Jewel
      crept gleefully after her, but was careful to hold her little skirts out
      of harm's way as they climbed down the steep bank and at last rested among
      the ferns by the brook. Its louder babble seemed to welcome them. Nature
      had been busy at her miracle working since the child's last visit. Without
      moving she could have gathered a handful of little blossoms. Instead, she
      rolled over and kissed a near clump of violets. &ldquo;You darling, darling
      things!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise looked up through far boughs to the fleece-flecked sky. &ldquo;Everything
      worth living for is right here, Jewel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Let's have a tent and
      not give any one our address.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we ought to let Dr. Ballard come, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now why did you pick him out?&rdquo; returned Eloise plaintively. She was
      resting her head against her clasped hands as she stretched herself
      against the incline of her verdant couch. Her companion did not reply at
      once, and Eloise lazily turned her head to where she could view the eyes
      fixed upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you thinking of, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was just thinking that if my mother made you a thin green dress that
      swept around you all long and narrow, you'd look like a flower, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl smiled back at the sky. &ldquo;That's very nice. You can think those
      thoughts all you please.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That wasn't all, though, because I was thinking about Dr. Ballard. He
      feels sorry. I couldn't tell you about it at lunch, because aunt Madge&mdash;well,
      because&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Eloise quietly. &ldquo;It is better for us to be alone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's brow relaxed. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said contentedly, &ldquo;in the Ravine of
      Happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look out, though,&rdquo; continued the girl in the same quiet tone and looking
      back at the sky. &ldquo;Look out what you say here. It is easy now to feel that
      all is harmonious, and that discords do not exist. I think even if
      grandfather appeared I could talk with him peacefully.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have thought about it,&rdquo; returned the child, &ldquo;and it seems hard to know
      what to say; but I love you and Dr. Ballard both, so it will be sure to
      come out right. He feels sorry if you are beginning to like to study
      Christian Science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, did he speak of that to you? I think he might have chosen a man
      of his size.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he spoke of it when he found out I wanted to ask you to take me
      to our church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where is the church here?&rdquo; Eloise abandoned her lazy tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have a hall. Mr. Reeves wrote it down for me. Do you really care,
      cousin Eloise? You've been so kind and helped me, but do you really begin
      to care?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Care? Who could help caring, if it is true? I've been reading some of the
      tales of cures in your magazine. If those people tell the truth&rdquo;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, cousin Eloise!&rdquo; The child's shocked eyes recalled the girl's
      self-centred thoughts.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon, dear. It was rude to say that. I'm not ill, Jewel. I'm
      so well and strong that&mdash;I've sometimes wished I wasn't, but life
      turned petty and disgusting to me. I resented everything. It is just as
      wonderful and radiant a star of hope to read that there is a sure way out
      of my tangle as if I had consumption and was promised a cure of that. I
      don't yet exactly believe it, but I don't disbelieve it. All I know is I
      want to read, read, read all the time. I was just thinking a minute ago
      that if we had the books here it would be perfect. This is the sort of
      place where it would be easiest to see that only the good is the real, and
      that the unsubstantiality of everything evil can be proved.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gave her head a little shake. &ldquo;Just think of poor Dr. Ballard being
      afraid to have you believe that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But who wouldn't be afraid to believe it, who wouldn't!&rdquo; exclaimed the
      girl vehemently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I've always known it, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; returned the child simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You dear baby. You haven't lived long. I don't want to climb into a
      fool's paradise only to fall out with a dull thud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked at her, grasping as well as she could her meaning. &ldquo;I know
      I'm only a little girl; but if you should go to church with me,&rdquo; she said,
      &ldquo;you'd see a lot of grown-up people who know it's true. Then we could go
      on Wednesday evenings and hear them tell what Christian Science has done
      for them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm sure I shouldn't like that,&rdquo; responded Eloise quickly. &ldquo;How can
      they bear to tell!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They don't think it's right not to. There are lots of other people
      besides you that are sorry and need to learn the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rebuke was so innocent and, withal, so direct, that honest Eloise
      turned toward Jewel and made an impulsive grasp toward her, capturing
      nothing but the edge of the child's dress, which she held firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're right, Jewel. I'm a selfish, thin-skinned creature,&rdquo; she declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little girl shook her head. &ldquo;You've got to stop thinking you are, you
      know,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;You have to know that the error Eloise isn't you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's mortal mind, I suppose,&rdquo; returned Eloise, smiling at the sound of
      the phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should think it was! Old thing! Always trying to cheat us!&rdquo; said Jewel.
      &ldquo;All that you have to do is to remember every minute that God's child must
      be manifested. He inherits every good and perfect thing, and has dominion
      over every belief of everything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise stared at her in wonder. &ldquo;Do you know what you've talking about,
      you little thing, when you use all those long words?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Don't you?&rdquo; asked the child. &ldquo;Oh, listen!&rdquo; for a bird suddenly
      poured a wild strain of melody from the treetop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And just think,&rdquo; said Jewel presently, in a soft, awestruck tone, &ldquo;that
      some people wear birds sewed on their hats, just as if they were glad
      something was dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It <i>is</i> weird,&rdquo; agreed Eloise. &ldquo;I never liked it. Jewel, did Dr.
      Ballard blame you because I am interested in Christian Science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said he wished I wouldn't talk to you and go to church and
      everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl bit a blade of grass and eyed the child's serious face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what are you going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I asked God to show me. I wish Dr. Ballard would study with you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is impossible. He has spent years learning his science, and he loves
      it and is proud of it; so what next?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very queer things happen sometimes,&rdquo; rejoined Jewel doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But not so queer as that would be,&rdquo; returned Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel was pondering. This was very delicate ground, and she still felt
      some awe of her cousin; however, there was only one thing to consider.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you love him better than anybody, cousin Eloise?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      A flood of color warmed the girl's face, but she had to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would that make the difference?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Mustn't we want the truth
      anyway?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel heaved a mighty sigh. She was thinking of Dr. Ballard's pensive
      eyes. &ldquo;I should <i>think</i> so,&rdquo; she answered frankly; &ldquo;because if you
      just study the truth, and hold on tight, how can things be anything but
      happy at last? I wish I was more grown up, cousin Eloise,&rdquo; she added
      apologetically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, no,&rdquo; answered the girl, with a little catch in her throat. &ldquo;I've
      had so much of grown-up people, Jewel! I'm so grown up myself! Just a
      little while ago I was a schoolgirl, busy and happy all the time. I never
      even went out anywhere except with father, and with Nat when he was at
      home from college. You don't know Nat, but you'd like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why! Is he a Christian Scientist?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For answer Eloise laughed low but heartily. &ldquo;Nat a Christian Scientist!&rdquo;
       she mused aloud. &ldquo;Not exactly, my little cousin!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then should I like him as well as Dr. Ballard?&rdquo; asked Jewel
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know. Tastes differ.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does he like horses?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He knows everything about a horse and a yacht except how to pay for them,
      poor boy,&rdquo; returned Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he is poor and expensive. It is a bad combination; it is almost as
      bad as being poor and extravagant. His mother is a widow, and they haven't
      much, but what there was she has insisted on spending on him&mdash;that
      is, all she could spare from the doctor's bills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She needs Science then, doesn't she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel, that would be one thing that would keep me from wanting to be a
      Scientist. What's the fun of being one unless everybody else is? My
      mother, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but then you'd find out how to help her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise glanced at the child curiously. She thought it would be interesting
      to peep into Jewel's mind and see her estimate of Aunt Madge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother has a great deal to trouble her,&rdquo; she said loyally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know she thinks she has,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again her response surprised her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take you as you are, Jewel,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm glad you're not grown
      up. You're fresher from the workshop.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XXI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AN EFFORT FOR TRUTH
    </h3>
    <p>
      When Eloise spoke in the ravine of talking with her grandfather, it was
      because for a few days she had been trying to make up her mind to an
      interview with him. A fortnight ago she would have felt this to be
      impossible; but subtle changes had been going on in herself, and, she
      thought, in him. If her mother would undertake the interview now and take
      that stand with Mr. Evringham which Eloise felt that self-respect
      demanded, the girl would gladly escape it; but there was no prospect of
      such a thing. Mrs. Evringham was only too glad to benefit by her
      father-in-law's modified mood, to glide along the surface of things and
      wait&mdash;Eloise knew it, knew it every day, in moments when her cheeks
      flushed hot&mdash;for Dr. Ballard to throw the handkerchief.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl wished to talk with Mr. Evringham without her mother's knowledge,
      and the prospect was a dreaded ordeal. She felt that they had won his
      contempt, and she feared the loss of her own self-control when she should
      come to touch upon the sore spots.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What would you do, Jewel,&rdquo; she asked the next morning, after they had
      read the lesson; &ldquo;what would you do if you were afraid of somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wouldn't be,&rdquo; returned the child quickly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I am. Now what am I going to do about it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna Belle, who always gave unwinking attention to the lesson, was in
      Jewel's lap, and the child twisted out the in-turning morocco foot as she
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I'd know that one thought of God couldn't be afraid of another,&rdquo; she
      replied in the conclusive tone to which Eloise could never grow
      accustomed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Jewel, child,&rdquo; the girl said impatiently, &ldquo;we'd be sorry to think
      most of the people we know are thoughts of God.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's because you get the error man mixed up with the real one. Mother
      explains that to me when we ride in cable cars and places where we see
      error people with sorry faces. There's a real man, a real thought of God,
      behind every one of them; and when you remember to think right about
      people every minute, you are doing them good. Did you say you're afraid of
      somebody?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that somebody is a man whom I must talk to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then begin right away to know every minute that the real man isn't
      anybody to be afraid of, for God made him, and God has only loving
      thoughts; and of course you must be loving all the time. It'll be just as
      <i>easy</i> by the time you come to it, cousin Eloise!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl often asked herself in these days why she should begin to feel
      unreasonably hopeful and lighter hearted. Her mother no longer complained
      of her moods. Mrs. Evringham laid the becoming change in her daughter's
      expression to the girl's happiness in discovering that she did reciprocate
      Dr. Ballard's evident sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloise is so high minded,&rdquo; thought the mother complacently. &ldquo;She would
      never be satisfied to marry for convenience, like so many;&rdquo; and
      considering herself passingly astute, she let well enough alone, ceased to
      bring the physician's name into every conversation, and bided her time.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning Mr. Evringham, coming out of the house to go to town, met
      Eloise on the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are down early,&rdquo; he said as he greeted her, and was passing on to the
      carriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just one minute, grandfather!&rdquo; she exclaimed, and how her heart beat. He
      turned his erect form in some surprise, and his cold eyes met the girlish
      ones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's a stunning creature,&rdquo; he thought, as the sunlight bathed her young
      beauty; but his face was impenetrable, and Eloise nerved herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you thinking of going golfing this afternoon?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought you said something about it at dinner last evening. Would you
      let me go with you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, much astonished, raised his eyebrows and took off the hat
      which he had replaced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such a request from youth and beauty is a command,&rdquo; he returned with a
      slight bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tears sprang to the girl's eyes. &ldquo;Don't make fun of me, grandfather!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed impulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not for worlds,&rdquo; he returned. &ldquo;You will do the laughing when you see me
      drive. My hand seems to have lost its cunning this spring. Shall we say
      four-thirty? Very well. Good-morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now what's all this?&rdquo; mused Mr. Evringham as he drove to the station.
      &ldquo;Has another granddaughter fallen in love with me? Methinks not. What is
      she after? Does she want to get away from Ballard? Methinks not, again.
      She's going to ask me for something probably. Egad, if she does, I think
      I'll turn her over to Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's eyes were bright during the lesson that morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's to-day, Jewel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I'm going to talk with that man I'm
      afraid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never say that again,&rdquo; returned the child vehemently. &ldquo;You are not
      afraid. There's no one to be afraid of. Do you want me to handle it for
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To declare the truth for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean give me a treatment for it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. Do you know that seems very funny to me, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It seems funny to me that you are afraid, when God made you, and the man,
      and all of us, and there's nothing but goodness and love in the universe.
      Fear is the belief of evil. Do you want to believe evil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hate to,&rdquo; returned Eloise promptly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you go away, cousin Eloise, and I will handle the case for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, are you going golfing?&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham that afternoon to her
      daughter. &ldquo;Do put on your white duck, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I intend to. I'm going with grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are?&rdquo; in extremest surprise. &ldquo;Oh, wear your dark skirt, dear; it's
      plenty good enough. Do you mean to say he asked you, Eloise?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I asked him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham stood in silent amaze, her brain working alertly. She even
      watched her daughter don the immaculate white golf suit, and made no
      further protest.
    </p>
    <p>
      What was in the girl's mind? When finally from her window she saw the two
      enter the brougham, Mr. Evringham carrying his granddaughter's clubs, she
      smiled a knowing smile and nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do believe I've wronged Eloise,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;How foolish it was to
      worry. I've been wondering how in the world I was going to get father to
      give her a wedding, and how I was going to get her to accept it, and now
      look! That child has thought of the same thing, and will manage it a
      hundred times better than I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel stood on the steps and waved her hand as the brougham rolled away.
      Eloise had seized and squeezed her surreptitiously in the hall before they
      came out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do feel braced up, Jewel. Thank you,&rdquo; she whispered hurriedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is the man over at the golf links?&rdquo; asked the child, surprised to see
      that Eloise and her grandfather were going out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He will be by the time I get there,&rdquo; returned the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      As soon as the carriage door had closed and they had started, Eloise
      spoke. &ldquo;You must think it very strange that I asked this of you,
      grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a hint of violets clinging to the fresh white garments that
      brushed Mr. Evringham's knee.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would not question the gifts the gods provide;&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed able to rise above the fear of his sarcasms. &ldquo;Not that you
      would be surprised at anything mother or I might ask of you,&rdquo; she
      continued bravely, &ldquo;but I have suffered, I'm sure, as much as you have
      during the last two months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed? I regret to hear that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If there was a sting in this reply, Eloise refused to recognize it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In fact I have felt so much that it has made it impossible hitherto to
      say anything, but Jewel has given me courage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham smoothed his mustache. &ldquo;She has plenty to spare,&rdquo; he
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says,&rdquo; went on Eloise, &ldquo;that everything that isn't love is hate; and
      hate, of course, in her category is unreal. It is because I want the real
      things, because I long for real things, for truth, that I asked to have
      this talk, grandfather, and I wanted to be quite alone with you, so I
      thought of this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the mater she's running away from, then,&rdquo; reflected her companion.
      He nodded courteously. &ldquo;I am at your disposal,&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      Subtly the broker's feeling toward Eloise had been changing since the
      evening in which Jewel wrote to her parents. His hard and fast opinion of
      her had been slightly shaken. The frankness of her remarks on Christian
      Science in the presence of Dr. Ballard the other evening had been a
      surprise to him. The cold, proud, noncommittal, ease-loving girl who in
      his opinion had decided to marry the young doctor was either less
      designing than he had believed, or else wonderfully certain of her own
      power to hold him. He found himself regarding her with new interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been waiting for mother to talk with you,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;and clear
      up our position; but she does not, and so I must.&rdquo; The speaker's hands
      were tightly clasped in her lap. &ldquo;I wish I had Jewel's unconsciousness,
      her certainty that all is Good, for I feel&mdash;I feel shame before you,
      grandfather.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It seemed to Mr. Evringham that Jewel's eyes were appealing to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She says,&rdquo; he returned with a rather grim smile, &ldquo;Jewel avers that I am
      kindness itself inside. Let us admit it for convenience now, and see if
      you can't speak freely.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you. You know what I am ashamed of: staying here so long; imposing
      upon you; taking everything for granted when we have no right. I want to
      understand our affairs; to know if we have anything, and what it is; to
      have you help me, <i>you</i>; to have you tell me how we can live
      independently, and help me to make mother agree to it. Oh, if you would&mdash;if
      you <i>could</i> be my friend, grandfather. I need you so!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham received this impetuous outburst without change of
      countenance. &ldquo;How about Ballard?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I thought he was going to
      settle all this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence in the brougham. The flash of hurt in the girl's eyes
      was quenched by quick tears. Her companion reddened under the look of
      surprise she bent upon him, her lovely lips unsteady.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No offense,&rdquo; he added hastily. &ldquo;Ballard's sentiments are evident enough,
      and he is a fine fellow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise controlled herself. &ldquo;Will you take the trouble to explain our
      affairs to me?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly,&rdquo; responded Mr. Evringham quickly. &ldquo;I wish for your sake there
      was more to explain, more possibilities in the case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have nothing?&rdquo; exclaimed the girl acutely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your father took heavy chances and lost. His affairs are nearly settled,
      and what there is left is small indeed.&rdquo; The speaker cast a quick glance
      at the girl beside him. She had caught her lip between her teeth. Jewel's
      soft voice sounded in his ears. &ldquo;Cousin Eloise feels sorry because she
      isn't your real relation.&rdquo; An inkling of what the girl might suffer came
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother and you have a claim upon me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;I should
      certainly feel a responsibility of all my son's debts, and the one to his
      wife and daughter in particular. I will try to make the situation easier
      for you in some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Manage for us to go away, grandfather. Haven't you a little house
      somewhere?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The beseeching in her tone surprised Mr. Evringham still more. What did
      the girl mean? Didn't she intend to marry Ballard? He had believed her to
      be planning to preside in the Mountain Avenue mansion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it can be arranged, certainly,&rdquo; he answered vaguely; &ldquo;but there's no
      hurry, Eloise,&rdquo; he added, in the kindest tone he had ever used toward her.
      &ldquo;Some evening we will go over the affairs, and I will show you where your
      mother stands financially, and we will try to make some plan that shall be
      satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise gave him a grateful look, as much in response to his manner as to
      his words. &ldquo;Thank you. The present condition is certainly&mdash;error,&rdquo;
       she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we'll try to find harmony,&rdquo; replied the other. &ldquo;Jewel would say it
      was easy. I should like to have you remain at my house at least as long as
      she does, Eloise. I should probably have to tie her hair ribbons again if
      you went.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two found themselves smiling at each other. The atmosphere was
      lightened, and the brougham drew up at the clubhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham handed out the girl, gave Zeke the order to return for them,
      and they went up the steps.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would drive back with him, grandfather, only that mother would wonder,
      and ask questions,&rdquo; said Eloise. &ldquo;Don't let me detain you in any way. I'll
      just sit here on the piazza.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not play? Nonsense!&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham brusquely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please don't feel obliged&rdquo;&mdash;Eloise began humbly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I can't help being obliged if you'll play with me,&rdquo; interrupted her
      companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some men observed the confidential attitude of the broker and the
      beautiful girl. &ldquo;What's doing over there?&rdquo; asked one. &ldquo;Is Evringham
      beginning to take notice?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, don't you know?&rdquo; returned the other. &ldquo;That's his granddaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter, do you mean? Didn't know he had one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it. She's Lawrence's stepdaughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other shook his head. &ldquo;That's too involved for me. She's a queen,
      anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Going to marry Ballard, they say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That so? Then I won't go up and fall on Evringham's neck. My bank book
      isn't in Ballard's class. She can play, too,&rdquo; as he observed Eloise make a
      drive while she waited the reappearance of her companion from the
      clubhouse. &ldquo;Isn't that a bird!&mdash;and say, there's young Lochinvar
      himself!&rdquo; for here a light automobile whizzed briskly up to the clubhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      Dr. Ballard sprang out, for he had recognized the figure at the first
      teeing ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You gave me the slip!&rdquo; he cried as he approached.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I just went with a handsomer man,&rdquo; returned Eloise, smiling, as they
      shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know I could come until the last minute, then I went to the
      house for you and found I had missed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham and the caddy approached. &ldquo;I cut you out for once, Ballard,&rdquo;
       he said. &ldquo;Well, we're off, Eloise. I saw you drive. I doubt if he catches
      us.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eyes questioned Eloise that evening when she reached home, and she
      received the smiling, significant nod her cousin gave her with
      satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was an apparently united family party that gathered about the dinner
      table. Mr. Evringham and Eloise discussed their game, while Mrs. Evringham
      fairly rustled with complacence.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Jewel clung to her grandfather's neck that evening in bidding him
      good-night, she whispered:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How happy we all are!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are we, really? Well now, that's very gratifying, I'm sure. Good-night,
      Jewel.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      IN THE HARNESS ROOM
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, can I have three dollars?&rdquo; asked Eloise the next morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Were you thinking of a new riding hat, dear? I do wish you had it to wear
      this afternoon. Yours is shabby, certainly, but you can't get it for that,
      child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; I was thinking of a copy of 'Science and Health.' I don't like to
      take Jewel's any longer, and I'm convinced.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What of&mdash;sin?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Evringham in dismay.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, just the opposite&mdash;that there needn't be any. The book teaches
      the truth. I know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, whether it does or doesn't, you haven't any three dollars to spend
      for a book, Eloise,&rdquo; was the firm reply. &ldquo;The <i>idea</i>, when I can
      barely rake and scrape enough together to keep us presentable!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where do you get our money?&rdquo; asked the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father gives me a check every fortnight. Of course you know that he has
      charge of our affairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's serene expression did not change. She looked at the little black
      book in her hand. &ldquo;This edition costs five dollars,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Scandalous!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;I can tell you this is no time
      for us to be collecting <i>editions de luxe</i>. Wait till you're
      married.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to run in town for a while this morning, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are? Well don't get belated. You know that you are to ride with Dr.
      Ballard at half past four. Dear me,&rdquo; her brow drawn, &ldquo;you ought to have
      that hat. Now I think that I <i>could</i> get on without that jet bolero.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise laughed softly and drew her mother to her. &ldquo;Have your jet bolero,
      dear,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;My hat isn't bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise went to her room, and closing the door, took from one of her
      drawers a box. It contained her girlish treasures, the ornaments and
      jewels her father had given her from time to time. She took out a small
      diamond ring and pressed it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear papa! I love it because you gave it to me, but I can get with it a
      wonderful thing, a truth which, if we had known it, would have saved you
      all those torturing hours, would have saved your dear life. I know how
      gladly you would have me get it now, for you are learning it too; and it
      will be your gift, dear, <i>dear</i> papa, your gift just the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel had to study the lesson with only Anna Belle's assistance that
      morning, but she received the third letter from her mother and father.
      Their trip was proving a success from the standpoints of both business and
      pleasure, but their chief longing was to get back to their little girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was very like visiting with them to read it over, and Jewel did so more
      than once. &ldquo;I'll show it to cousin Eloise as soon as she comes home,&rdquo; she
      reflected. Then she dressed Anna Belle to go out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Running downstairs the child sought and found Mrs. Forbes in the kitchen.
      The housekeeper no longer questioned her going and coming, although she
      still considered herself in the light of the child's only disciplinarian,
      and was vigilant to watch for errors of omission and commission, and quick
      to correct them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes, may I have an old kitchen knife?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly not. You'll cut yourself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want it to dig up plants.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes stared down at her. &ldquo;Why, you mustn't do any such thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean wild flowers for a garden that Anna Belle and I are going to
      make.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh. I'll see if I can't find you a trowel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was one at hand, and as the housekeeper passed it to the child she
      warned her:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be careful you don't make a mistake, now, and get hold of anybody's
      plants. What did your cousin Eloise go to New York for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I hope it's for her trousseau.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel smiled. &ldquo;My mother makes those.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe she'll ever make one for you, then,&rdquo; returned Mrs.
      Forbes, but not ill-naturedly. She laughed, glancing at Sarah, who stood
      by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I think she will for Anna Belle,&rdquo; returned Jewel brightly, &ldquo;when she
      gets older.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper and maid both laughed. &ldquo;Run along,&rdquo; said Mrs. Forbes, &ldquo;and
      don't you be late for lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's an awful sweet child,&rdquo; said Sarah half reproachfully. &ldquo;Just the
      spirit of sunshine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, they'd turn her head here if it wasn't for me,&rdquo; answered the
      other complacently.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel was not late to lunch, but eating it tete-a-tete with aunt Madge was
      not to her taste.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham utilized the opportunity to admonish her, and Mrs. Forbes
      for once sympathized with the widow's sentiments.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Madge took off her eyeglasses in a way she had when she wished to be
      particularly impressive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I don't think any one has told you that it is impolite
      to Dr. Ballard to say anything about Christian Science in his presence.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is it?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because he is a learned physician, and has, of course, a great respect
      for his profession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have a great respect for him,&rdquo; returned the child, &ldquo;and he knows I
      wouldn't hurt his feelings.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The idea!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham, looking down from a height upon the
      flaxen head. &ldquo;As if a little ignorant girl could hurt the feelings of a
      man like Dr. Ballard!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes also stared at the child, and she winced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do love them, and they do love me,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I don't remember ever
      speaking about it before the doctor unless somebody asked me,&rdquo; she said
      aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your cousin Eloise may ask you,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;Nobody else
      would. She does it in a spirit of mischief, perhaps, but I shall speak to
      her. She has a passing curiosity about your ideas because it is odd and
      rather amusing to find a child who has such unnatural and precocious
      fancies, and she tries to draw you out; but it will not last with her.
      Neither will it with you, probably. You seem to be a sensible little girl
      in many ways.&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham made the addition magnanimously. She really
      was too much at peace with all the world just now to like to be severe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outwardly Jewel was silent. Inwardly she was declaring many things which
      would have surprised her companions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does your cousin Eloise pretend to you that she is becoming seriously
      interested in your faith?&rdquo; pursued Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She will tell you all about it,&rdquo; returned Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aunt Madge shrugged her shoulders and laughed a little. Her thoughts
      reverted to her daughter's trip to the city. She had wondered several
      times if it had any pleasant connection with her sudden good understanding
      with Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      To Jewel's relief her thoughts remained preoccupied during the remainder
      of the meal; and as soon as the child could leave, she flew to the closet
      under the stairs, where Anna Belle often went into retreat during the
      luncheon hour, and from thence back to the garden she was making by the
      brookside.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she returned to the house her eyes lighted as she saw two horses
      before the piazza, and Dr. Ballard standing beside one of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Jewel?&rdquo; he asked, as she danced up to him smiling. Stooping,
      he lifted her into the side saddle, from whence she beamed upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, what fun you're going to have!&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd like to be sure of that,&rdquo; he answered, his gloved hand on the pommel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; incredulously. &ldquo;You don't like that automobile better,
      do you? They're so&mdash;so stubby. I must have a horse, a horse!&rdquo; She
      smoothed and patted her steed lovingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to have&mdash;Jewel of the world,&rdquo; he said kindly. &ldquo;My bad
      angel!&rdquo; he added, looking up quizzically into her eyes, and smiling at the
      widening wonder that grew in them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your&mdash;what?&rdquo; she asked, and then Eloise came out in her habit.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going instead of you,&rdquo; cried the child gayly, &ldquo;to pay you for staying
      away all day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you miss me?&rdquo; asked the girl as she shook hands with her escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried not to. Anna Belle and I have something to show you in the
      ravine.&rdquo; As she spoke, Jewel slid down into the doctor's arms, and stood
      on the steps watching while he put Eloise up and mounted himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child's eyes dwelt upon the pair admiringly as they waved their hands
      to her and rode away. Little she knew how their hearts were beating. Mrs.
      Evringham, watching from an upper window, suspected it. She felt that this
      afternoon would end all suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child gave a wistful sigh as the horses disappeared, and jumping off
      the piazza, she wandered around the house toward the stable. There had
      been no rules laid down to her since the night of Essex Maid's attack, and
      Zeke was always a congenial companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she neared the barn a young fellow left it, laughing. She knew who he
      was,&mdash;one of the young men Zeke had known in Boston. He had several
      times of late come to call on his old chum, for he was out of work.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he left the barn he saw the child and slouched off to one side,
      avoiding her; but she scarcely noticed him, congratulating herself that
      Zeke would be alone and ready, as usual, to crack jokes and stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coachman was not in sight as she entered, but she knew she would find
      him in the harness room. Its door stood ajar, and as the child approached
      she heard a strange sound, as of some one weeping suppressedly. Sturdily
      resisting the sudden fear that swept to her heart, she pushed open the
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      There stood Mrs. Forbes, leaning against a wooden support, her forehead
      resting against her clasped hands in a hopeless posture, as she sobbed
      heavily. The air was filled with an odor which had for Jewel sickening
      associations. The only terror, the only tragedy, of her short life was
      wrapped about with this pungent smell. She seemed again to hear her
      mother's sobs, to feel once more that sensation of all things coming to
      ruin which descended upon her at the unprecedented sight and sound of her
      strong mother's emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      All at once she perceived Zeke sitting on a low chair, his arms hanging
      across his knees and his head fallen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child turned very pale. Her doll slid unnoticed to the floor, as she
      pressed her little hands to her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, Mother, God,&rdquo; she murmured in gasps. &ldquo;Thou art all power. We are
      thy children. Error has no power over us. Help us to waken from this lie.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Running up to the housekeeper, she clasped her arms about her convulsed
      form. &ldquo;Dear Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said, her soft voice trembling at first but
      growing firm, &ldquo;I know this claim, but it can be healed. It seems very
      terrible, but it's nothing. We know it, we must know it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman lifted her head and looked down with swollen eyes upon the
      child. She saw her go unhesitatingly across to Zeke and kneel beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be discouraged, Zeke,&rdquo; she said lovingly. &ldquo;I know how it seems, but
      my father had it and he was healed. You will be healed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The coachman lifted his rumpled head and stared at her with bloodshot
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great fuss 'bout nothing,&rdquo; he said sullenly. &ldquo;Mother always fussing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Something in his look made the child shudder. Resisting the sudden
      repugnance to one who had always shown her kindness, she impulsively took
      his big hand in both her little ones. &ldquo;Zeke, what is error saying to you?&rdquo;
       she demanded. &ldquo;You can't look at me without love. I love you because God
      does. He is lifting us out of this error belief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young fellow returned the clasp of the soft hands and winked his eyes
      like one who is waking. &ldquo;Mother makes great fuss,&rdquo; he grumbled. &ldquo;Scott was
      here. We had two or three little friendly drinks. Ma had to come in and
      blubber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What friendly drinks? What do you mean?&rdquo; demanded Jewel, looking all
      about her. Her eyes fell upon a large black bottle. She dropped the
      coachman's hand and picked it up. She smelled of it, her eyes dilated, and
      she began to tremble again; and throwing the whiskey from her, she buried
      her face for a moment against Zeke's shirt sleeve.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it in a bottle!&rdquo; she exclaimed at last, in a hushed voice, drawing
      back and regarding the coachman with such a white and horrified
      countenance that it frightened the clouds from his brain. &ldquo;Is that
      terrible claim in a bottle, and do people drink it out?&rdquo; she asked slowly,
      and in an awestruck tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's no harm,&rdquo; began Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No harm when your mother is crying, when your face is full of error, and
      your eyes were hating? No harm when my mother cried, and all our gladness
      was gone? Would you go and drink a claim like that out of a bottle&mdash;of
      your own accord?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke wriggled under the blue eyes and the unnatural rigidity of the
      child's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jewel, he wouldn't,&rdquo; groaned Mrs. Forbes suddenly. &ldquo;Zeke's a good
      boy, but he's inherited that. His father died of it. It's a disease,
      child. I thought my boy would escape, but he hasn't! It's the end!&rdquo; cried
      the wretched woman. &ldquo;What will Mr. Evringham say! To think how I blamed
      Fanshaw! Zeke'll lose his place and go downhill, and I shall die of shame
      and despair.&rdquo; Her sobs again shook her from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel continued to look at Zeke. A new, eager expression stole over her
      face. &ldquo;<i>Is</i> it the end?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Don't you believe in God?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; answered the coachman sullenly. &ldquo;I know I'm a man, too. I
      can control myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Nobody can. Even Jesus said, 'Of myself I can do nothing.' Only God
      can help you. If you can drink that nasty smelling stuff, and get all red
      and rumply and sorry, then you need God the worst of anybody in Bel-Air.
      You look better now. It's just like a dream, the way you lifted up your
      face to me when I came in, and it <i>was</i> a dream. I'll help you, Zeke.
      I'll show you how to find help.&rdquo; The child suddenly leaned toward the
      young fellow, and then retreated. &ldquo;I can't stand your breath!&rdquo; she
      exclaimed, &ldquo;and I like to get close to the people I love.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This seemed to touch Zeke. He blushed hotly. &ldquo;It's a darned shame, kid,&rdquo;
       he returned sheepishly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Forbes, come here, please,&rdquo; said Jewel. The housekeeper had ceased
      crying, and was watching the pair. She saw that her boy's senses were
      clearer. She approached obediently, and when the child took her hand her
      own closed tightly upon the little fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeke, you're a big strong man and everybody likes you,&rdquo; said Jewel
      earnestly. &ldquo;Isn't it better to stay that way than to drink out of a
      bottle, no matter <i>how</i> much you like it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like it so awfully,&rdquo; returned Zeke protestingly. &ldquo;I like to be
      sociable with the boys, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a way to be sociable!&rdquo; gasped the child. &ldquo;Well, wouldn't you rather
      be nice, so people will like to get close to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Depends on the folks,&rdquo; returned the boy with a touch of his usual manner.
      &ldquo;You're all right, little kid.&rdquo; He put out his hand, but quickly withdrew
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel seized it. &ldquo;Now give your other one to your mother. There now, we're
      all together. If your mother thinks you have a disease, Zeke, then she
      must know you haven't. If you want me to, I'll come out here every day at
      a quiet time and give you a treatment, and we'll talk all about Christian
      Science, and we'll know that there's nothing that can make us sick or
      unhappy&mdash;or unkind! Think of your unkindness to your mother&mdash;and
      to me if you go on, for I love you, Zeke. Now <i>may</i> I help you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The soft frank voice, the earnest little face, moved Zeke to cast a glance
      at his mother's swollen eyes. They were bent upon Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you say your father was cured that way, child?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Forbes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Oh yes! and he's so happy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Zeke, let's all be thankful if there's <i>anything</i>,&rdquo; said the woman
      tremulously, turning to him appealingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd just as soon have a visit from you every day, little kid,&rdquo; said the
      young fellow. &ldquo;You're a corker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you must want more than me,&rdquo; returned the child. &ldquo;God and healing and
      purity and goodness! If you're in earnest, what are you going to do with
      that?&rdquo; She touched the black bottle with the toe of her shoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zeke looked at the whiskey, then back into her eyes. They were full of
      love and faith for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stooped and picked up the bottle, then striding to a window, he flung
      it out toward the forest trees with all the force of his strong arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn the stuff!&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes felt herself tremble from head to foot. She bit her lip.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her son turned back. &ldquo;Getting near train time,&rdquo; he added, not looking at
      his companions. &ldquo;Guess I'll go upstairs.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When he had disappeared his mother stooped slowly and kissed Jewel.
      &ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; she said tremulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What for?&rdquo; asked the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The housekeeper still stood in the harness room after Jewel had gone away.
      She bowed her head on her folded hands. &ldquo;Our Father who art in heaven,
      forgive me,&rdquo; she prayed. &ldquo;Forgive me for being a fool. Forgive me for not
      recognizing Thine angel whom Thou hast sent. Amen.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MRS. EVRINGHAM'S CALLER
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham was busily chewing the cud of sweet fancies only, that
      afternoon. Following the equestrians in their leafy woodland path, she
      pictured them as talking of their future, and herself built many castles
      in the air. &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she thought sentimentally, leaning back in her reclining
      chair, &ldquo;how charming is youth&mdash;with plenty of money!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was roused from these luxurious meditations by the appearance of
      Sarah, bearing a card on a salver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man!&rdquo; she exclaimed with annoyance. &ldquo;I'm not dressed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Lifting the card, she read it with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Nathan Wycliffe Bonnell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him I'll be down soon,&rdquo; was all she said; but her thoughts ran
      swiftly as she hurriedly slipped into her gown. &ldquo;How in the world comes
      the boy out here? Just as well that Eloise is away. It would only be
      painful to her, all the old associations.&rdquo; But old associations cropped up
      more and more enticingly for Mrs. Evringham as she made her swift toilet,
      and by the time she reached the drawing-room her eagerness lent her
      cordiality a very genuine tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat, dear boy, how are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man who rose eagerly to meet her would have been noticeable in
      any crowd. She gazed up into his smooth-shaven, frank face, with its alert
      eyes and strong chin, and felt a yearning affection for all which he
      represented to her. &ldquo;What are you doing out here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Visiting you and Eloise,&rdquo; he answered, with the hearty relish which
      always characterized his manner when circumstances were agreeable. &ldquo;Where
      is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Riding. I don't know when they will come home, either. It's such a
      charming day, isn't it? So good of you to hunt us up, Nat. We've been out
      of the world so long. I can't tell you what a rush of memories comes over
      me at sight of you, you nice, big boy. I do believe you've been growing.&rdquo;
       She gave a glance of approval at the young man's stalwart proportions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't humiliate me,&rdquo; he laughed, as she drew him to a divan, where
      they seated themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How could you get away at this hour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm changing my business, and get a week's vacation thereby. Great luck,
      isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope so. Are you going to do better?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much better. It's only a little matter of time now, Mrs. Evringham&mdash;automobiles,
      steam yachts, and all the rest of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, the optimism of youth!&rdquo; she sighed, gazing at the dancing lights in
      his eyes. &ldquo;It's very beautiful, and usually entirely unfounded. You look
      so radiant, my dear. Perhaps you have come out here to let us congratulate
      you. Have you found that desirable girl? I certainly should be the first
      to be told, for I always talked to you very plainly, didn't I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed you did, Mrs. Evringham. You always kept my ineligibility before
      me strenuously.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A certain <i>sort</i> of ineligibility, dear boy,&rdquo; returned the lady with
      a flattering cadence. &ldquo;Your capital did not happen to consist of money.
      Tell me all, Nat. Who is she?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;She's still not impossible, but improbable,&rdquo; he
      returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are too difficult, my dear. Really, I thought at the time our
      misfortunes fell upon us that it was going to be Miss Caton. She would
      have been a great assistance to you, Nat. It isn't as if you could even
      afford to be a bachelor. In these days so much is expected of them. How is
      your mother?&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham made the addition in that tone of fixed
      sympathy which one employs when only a depressing answer can be expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean as well as usual, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean well. Wonderful, isn't it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, Nat?&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham straightened up in her interest. &ldquo;Who did
      it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was healed by Christian Science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham thanked her holy stars that Eloise was absent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well! I never for one moment classed your mother as a <i>malade
      imaginaire</i>!&rdquo; exclaimed the lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her companion raised his eyebrows. &ldquo;I fancy no one did who knew her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You believe it, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should be an idiot if I didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say she is out of her wheeled chair?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No chairs for her now. When she wishes to walk she walks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then she always could!&rdquo; declared Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you know better than that,&rdquo; returned the other calmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How long since?&rdquo; asked Mrs. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Aren't you glad for her?&rdquo; asked Bonnell with a slight smile of curiosity
      into the disturbed face. &ldquo;I ought to have told you at first that
      osteopathy did it; then after your joy had subsided, break the truth
      gently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I'm glad,&rdquo; returned the other stiffly, &ldquo;but I'd rather Eloise
      did not hear of it at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I know why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. We have a very dear friend who is a physician. It looks very
      much as if he might be something nearer than a friend. It is he with whom
      Eloise is riding this afternoon. It is very distasteful, naturally, to
      have these alleged cures discussed in our family. We have had some
      annoyance in that line already. You can understand how doctors must feel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, so long as they believe a cure to be only alleged; but where one is
      convinced that previously hopeless conditions have been healed, and it
      does happen once in a while, they are glad of it, I'm confident. We
      haven't a finer, broader minded class of men in our country than our
      physicians.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; agreed Mrs. Evringham, drawing herself up with a fleeting
      vision of the Ballard place on Mountain Avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But they are not the wealthiest at the start,&rdquo; said Nat. &ldquo;Is it possible
      that you are allowing Eloise to ride unchaperoned with a young physician?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham did not remark the threatening curves at the corners of the
      speaker's lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, this one is different,&rdquo; she returned seriously; &ldquo;very fine
      connections, and substantial in <i>every</i> way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her companion threw back his head and laughed frankly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We have to smile at each other once in a while, don't we, Mrs.
      Evringham?&rdquo; he said, in the light, caressing manner which had for a few
      years been one of her chief worries; &ldquo;but all the same, you're fond of me
      just as long as I don't forget my place, eh? You're glad to see me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know I am.&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham pressed her hand against the laces over
      her heart. &ldquo;Such a bittersweet feeling comes over me at the very tones of
      your voice. Oh, the happy past, Nat! Gone forever!&rdquo; She touched a dainty
      handkerchief to her eyes. &ldquo;I suppose your mother is still in her
      apartment?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has taken a place at View Point for the summer, and has set her heart
      on a long visit from you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How very kind of her,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Evringham with genuine gratitude.
      &ldquo;I don't know what father means to do in the hot weather or whether he&mdash;or
      whether I should wish to go with him. Your mother and I always enjoyed
      each other, when she was sufficiently free from suffering.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That time is always now,&rdquo; returned Nat, a fullness of gratitude in his
      voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      His companion looked at him curiously. &ldquo;I can't realize it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come and see,&rdquo; was his reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will, I certainly will. I shall anticipate it with great pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A very convenient place to prepare a part of Eloise's trousseau, Mrs.
      Evringham was considering, and the girl safely engaged, Nat's presence
      would have no terrors. &ldquo;You think you are really getting into a good
      business arrangement now?&rdquo; she asked aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very. I wake up in the morning wondering at my own good fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad, my dear boy,&rdquo; responded the other sympathetically.
      &ldquo;Perhaps, after all, you will be able to wait for a little more chin than
      Miss Caton has. Of course she's a very <i>nice</i> girl and all that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell smiled at the carpet.
    </p>
    <p>
      They talked on for half an hour of mutual friends over cups of tea, and
      then he rose to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloise will be sorry!&rdquo; said Mrs. Evringham effusively. &ldquo;It's such a long
      way out here and so difficult for you to get the time. It isn't as if you
      could come easily.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have several days here. I'm staying at the Reeves's. Do you know
      them?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; returned the lady, trying to conceal that this was a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Mr. Reeves with whom I am going into business, and we are doing
      some preliminary work. I shall see Eloise soon. Remember me to her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, certainly,&rdquo; replied Mrs. Evringham. She kept a stiff upper lip until
      she was alone, and then a troubled line grew in her forehead.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will be all right, of course, if things are settled,&rdquo; she thought. &ldquo;I
      can scarcely wait for Eloise to come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel had come from the barn straight to her room, where she thought upon
      her problem with the aids she loved.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last she went downstairs to a side door to watch for Zeke as he drove
      from the barn on his way to the station to meet Mr. Evringham. As the
      horse walked out of the barn she emerged and intercepted the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes at a window saw Zeke stop. She wondered what Jewel was saying
      to him, wondered with a humble gratitude novel to her dominating nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait one minute, Zeke,&rdquo; said the child. &ldquo;I've been wondering whether I
      ought to say anything to grandpa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you do I'll lose my place,&rdquo; returned the young fellow; &ldquo;and I've never
      done wrong by the horses yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you haven't. God has taken care of you, hasn't he, Zeke? Do you
      think it's right for me not to tell grandpa? I've decided that I'll do
      whatever you say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the wisdom of the serpent and the harmlessness of the dove. Zeke,
      nervously fingering the whip handle, looked down into the guileless face
      and mentally vowed never to betray the trust he saw there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don't tell him, Jewel,&rdquo; he returned rather thickly, for the fullness
      in his throat. &ldquo;You come out to the barn the way you said you would, and
      we'll talk over things. I don't care if the boys do laugh. I've sworn off.
      I believe you helped Essex Maid the other night. I believe you can help
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel's eyes were joyful. &ldquo;If you know you <i>want</i> help, Zeke, then
      you'll get it. Mother says that's the first thing. Mortal mind is so
      proud.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mine ain't strutting much,&rdquo; returned Zeke as he drove on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel amused herself about the grounds until the phaeton should return
      with her grandfather.
    </p>
    <p>
      When she saw it coming she ran down to the gate and hopped and skipped
      back beside it, Mr. Evringham watching her gyrations unsmilingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he dismounted at the piazza she clung to his hand going up the steps.
      &ldquo;Which are you going to do, grandpa, go riding or play golf?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Which do you want me to do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you ride it's more fun for me,&rdquo; she replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      He seated himself in one of the chairs and she leaned against its broad
      arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's rather more fun for me, too. I'm growing lazy. I think I'll ride.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have you been doing to-day, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo;&mdash;meditatively,&mdash;&ldquo;cousin Eloise went to New York, so I
      had to get my lesson alone. And I didn't braid my hair over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham looked startled. &ldquo;She'll do it, I dare say, before dinner,&rdquo;
       he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she has time. She has gone riding with Dr. Ballard. They just trotted
      away together. Oh, it was lovely!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham, leaning his head back, looked off under his heavy brows as
      he responded:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Across the hills and far away,
     Beyond their utmost purple rim,
     And deep into the dying day
     The happy princess followed him,
</pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;and all that sort of business, I suppose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean,&rdquo; said Jewel doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope not. Well, what else have you done? Been treating any
      rheumatism? I haven't had it since the sun shone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You never asked me to,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham smiled. &ldquo;The sunshine is a pretty good treatment,&rdquo; he
      observed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sometimes your belief comes into my thought,&rdquo; said Jewel, &ldquo;and of course
      I always turn on it and think the truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged, I'm sure. I'd like to turn on it myself at times.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You can study with cousin Eloise and me, if you'd like to,&rdquo; said Jewel
      eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, thank you,&rdquo; rejoined the broker hastily. &ldquo;Don't disturb
      yourself. There must be some sinners, you know, or the saints would have
      to go out of business&mdash;nobody to practice on. Well, have you been to
      the ravine?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes! Anna Belle and I, and we had more <i>fun</i>! We made a garden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning or afternoon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well I wish to know,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham in a suddenly serious and
      impressive tone, &ldquo;I wish to know if you reached home in time for lunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel felt somewhat startled under the daze of his piercing eyes, but her
      conscience was clear. &ldquo;Yes, I was here in plenty of time. I wanted to
      surely not be late, so I was here too soon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I was afraid of,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham gravely. &ldquo;I don't
      wish you to be unpunctual, but I object equally to your returning
      unnecessarily early when you wish to stay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I couldn't help it, grandpa,&rdquo; Jewel began earnestly, when he
      interrupted her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I've brought you this,&rdquo; he added, and took from his pocket an oblong
      package, sealed at each end.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child laid her doll in the broker's lap,&mdash;he had become hardened
      to this indignity,&mdash;and her fingers broke the seals and slipped the
      paper from a morocco case.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Push the spring in the end,&rdquo; said Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed. The lid flew up and disclosed a small silver chatelaine watch.
      The pin was a cherub's head, its wings enameled in white, as were the back
      and edges of the little timepiece whose hands were busily pointing to blue
      figures.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gasped. &ldquo;For me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her grandfather smoothed his mustache. He had presented gifts to ladies
      before, but never with such effect.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, grandpa!&rdquo; she exclaimed, touching the little watch in wondering
      delight. &ldquo;See what Divine Love has sent me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham raised his eyebrows and smiled, but he was soon assured that
      Love's messenger was not forgotten. He was instantly enveloped in a
      rapturous hug, and heroically endured the bitter of the watchcase pressing
      into his jugular for the sweet of the rose-leaf kisses that were
      assaulting his cheek like the quick reports of a tiny Gatling gun.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See if you can wind it,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel lifted her treasure tenderly from its velvet bed, and he showed her
      how to twist its stem, and then pinned it securely on the breast of her
      light sailor suit, where she looked down upon it in rapt admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then, Jewel, you have no excuse!&rdquo; he said severely.
    </p>
    <p>
      She raised her happy eyes, while her hand pressed the satin surface of her
      watch. &ldquo;Grandpa, grandpa!&rdquo; she said, sighing ecstatically, &ldquo;you're such a
      joker!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER XXIV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      THE RAVINE GARDEN
    </h3>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham tried heroically to look impassive when her daughter
      returned from the ride. There was barely time then to dress for dinner,
      and no opportunity for confidences before the meal, nor afterward until
      bedtime; but the look of peace and sweetness in Eloise's face could have
      but one significance to the mother, who believed that peace lay only in
      the direction upon which she had set her heart.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham took coffee with them after dinner in the drawing-room,
      while Jewel caressed her watch, never tiring of looking at its clear face
      and the little second hand which traveled so steadily its tiny circuit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked often toward the door, expectant of the doctor's
      entrance. The evening wore on and he did not come. Still Eloise's face
      wore the placid, restful expression. A gentle ease with her grandfather
      replaced her old manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her mother determined to try an experiment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could never guess who called to-day, Eloise,&rdquo; she said suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her daughter looked up from her coffee. &ldquo;No. Who was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat Bonnell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really!&rdquo; The girl's tone indicated great surprise, and that only. &ldquo;I wish
      I might have seen him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The addition was made so calmly, almost perfunctorily, that Mrs. Evringham
      smiled with exultation.
    </p>
    <p>
      She turned to her father-in-law. &ldquo;Who would believe that Mr. Bonnell was
      Eloise's brightest flame a year ago? 'How soon are we forgot!'&rdquo; she said
      lightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Jewel had kissed them all good-night and gone upstairs, and Mr.
      Evringham had withdrawn to his library, Mrs. Evringham took her child's
      hand and looked fondly into her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; returned Eloise, &ldquo;do tell me everything Nat said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After you've told me everything Dr. Ballard said. I supposed you'd fly to
      tell me, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl looked tenderly back into the eyes that were sharp with inquiry.
      &ldquo;Dear little mother,&rdquo; she returned, &ldquo;it can't be.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What can't be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you wish. Dr. Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you&mdash;refused him&mdash;!&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham's face whitened, and
      unconsciously she stepped back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It didn't have to come to that. Dr. Ballard is so fine&mdash;such a wise
      man in so many ways. I do admire him so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you say to him? I will know!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham
      passionately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise was mute, and her eyes besought her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Speak, I say! Was it Christian Science? Did you dare, Eloise Evringham,
      did you <i>dare</i> spoil your life&mdash;my life&mdash;our future, by
      scaring Dr. Ballard with that bugbear?&rdquo; The angry woman was breathing
      fast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother dear, don't give us something so painful to remember. Don't, I beg
      of you. Dr. Ballard does not reproach me. He thinks I shall change, and he
      wishes to give me time to see if I do. Think of him, if you will not think
      of me. He would be so shocked to have you take it this way. If you could
      have seen how kind he was, how patient. Dear mother, don't cry. It isn't
      anything I can help, unless I should deliberately turn dishonest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Evringham did cry, and heartily. She hurried away to her own room
      as quickly as possible, and locked the door against Eloise, who lay awake
      for hours with a strange mingling of regret and joy at her heart, and a
      constant declaring of the truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      At midnight the girl heard the door unlock and saw her mother emerge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling mamma!&rdquo; she exclaimed, springing out of bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Eloise,&rdquo; moaned the poor woman, dissolving again upon her child's
      shoulder. &ldquo;I never went to bed without your kiss, and I can't bear it. How
      can you be so cru&mdash;cru&mdash;cruel!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Darling, everything is going to come right,&rdquo; returned Eloise, holding her
      close. &ldquo;Nothing good would come of doing wrong. I never loved you so much
      as now. I never saw duty so plainly. Dearest, in one way I suffer for you,
      but still I was never so happy. I have grasped the end of the clue that
      will surely lead us safely through the labyrinth, no matter what life
      brings. You will see, mamma dear, after a while you will see. Don't go
      back. Come into my bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Disconsolately Mrs. Evringham obeyed, and in a few minutes, worn out with
      emotion, she had sobbed herself to sleep in her child's arms; and although
      for many days afterward she wore a languid air, and declared that there
      was nothing to live for, she yielded herself to Eloise's courageous and
      quietly joyful atmosphere, with silent wonder at her child's altered
      outlook.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning following the painful interview with her mother, Eloise
      presented herself in Jewel's room at the usual hour.
    </p>
    <p>
      Smiling, she approached the child and exhibited three fresh new books.
      India paper editions of the Bible and &ldquo;Science and Health,&rdquo; and the little
      brown pamphlet were in her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yours?&rdquo; exclaimed the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, good!&rdquo; Jewel hopped up and down, and forthwith brought Anna Belle
      to have her share in the rejoicing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were afraid you couldn't get them. Now see!&rdquo; cried the child
      triumphantly. &ldquo;As if Divine Love couldn't send you those books!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He showed me a way,&rdquo; returned the girl. &ldquo;See where I've written my name.
      I want you to put 'Jewel' right under it in each one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, in those lovely books?&rdquo; said the child doubtfully. &ldquo;I don't write
      very well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I want it, dear, when we go downstairs and can get some ink. Did
      anybody fix your hair yesterday?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just brushed it down real smooth on the outside,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It looks so,&rdquo; said Eloise, laughing. &ldquo;Let's fix it before we have the
      lesson. By the way, what time is it, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little girl smiled back at her cousin's reflection in the glass, and
      took the open morocco case from the bureau. &ldquo;Anna Belle and I put him to
      bed last night,&rdquo; she said, looking fondly at the silver cherub on its
      velvet couch. &ldquo;We've named him Little Faithful. He'll come to the lesson,
      too. I know he's going to be a lovely Scientist.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I hope he will, and neither be fast nor lazy,&rdquo; returned Eloise,
      as she unbraided the short pigtails.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you it wasn't so nice getting the lesson alone yesterday,&rdquo; said
      Jewel. &ldquo;You were away all day! Did you have a nice ride?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Eloise responded slowly. &ldquo;The day was very nice&mdash;and so is Dr.
      Ballard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he enjoy it?&rdquo; asked the child hopefully. The doctor had been a good
      deal on her mind.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of the time,&rdquo; responded Eloise soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not all the time? Did error creep in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The older girl brushed away in silence for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't mean to talk about grown-up things,&rdquo; said the child, somewhat
      abashed. &ldquo;Mother says I must be careful not to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is all right, Jewel. The new ideas I have been learning have made me
      see some things so clearly. One is to perceive what it is that really
      draws people together in a bond that cannot be broken. There is only one
      thing that can do it and will do it, and that is loving the same truth.
      Two people can have a very good time together for a while, and like each
      other very much, but the time comes when their thoughts fly apart unless
      that one bond of union is there&mdash;unless they love the same spiritual
      truth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The speaker caught, in the glass, the child's eyes fixed attentively upon
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wouldn't Dr. Ballard look at our book?&rdquo; asked Jewel softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, dear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child reflected a minute, and her eyes filled. &ldquo;I just love him,&rdquo; she
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her cousin stooped and kissed her cheek. &ldquo;You well may,&rdquo; she returned
      quietly. &ldquo;He deserves it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They studied the lesson and then went downstairs, where Jewel in her very
      best hand slowly transcribed her name in the new books; then she told
      Eloise that she was going out to the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to visit with Zeke,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has a claim of error, and he
      is willing Science should help him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is he ill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel looked off. &ldquo;It isn't that kind of error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are plenty worse,&rdquo; rejoined Eloise. She looked doubtfully at the
      little girl. &ldquo;Wouldn't you better tell me, dear? Is it right for you to
      go?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's right. His mother knows it, and she's so kind to me. What do
      you think! At breakfast she asked me if I wouldn't like to bring Anna
      Belle down. She says I can bring her to the table whenever I want to.
      Isn't it nice? The dear little creature has been so patient, never having
      a thing to eat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise could not help laughing, the manner in which Jewel finished was so
      suddenly quaint; but she shook her head in silent wonder as she watched
      the short skirted figure setting forth for the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh cousin Eloise.&rdquo; Jewel turned around. &ldquo;Will you come to the ravine
      after lunch, and see what Anna Belle and I have done?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel walked on a little further and turned again. &ldquo;You won't wear your
      watch, will you?&rdquo; she called.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll surely forget it,&rdquo; returned the girl, smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      The small figure went on, well content.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, if I could only be invisible in that barn!&rdquo; soliloquized Eloise. &ldquo;How
      I would like to hear what she will say. How wonderful it is that that
      little child has more chance of success, whatever trouble Zeke has been
      getting into, than any full-grown, experienced sage, philosopher, or
      reformer, who is a worker in mortal mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna Belle came to luncheon that day. Mrs. Forbes actually put a cushion
      in one of the chairs to lift the honored guest to such a height that her
      rosy smile was visible above the tablecloth. Not content with this
      hospitality, the housekeeper brought a bread-and-butter plate, upon which
      she placed such small proportions of food as might be calculated to tempt
      a dainty appetite. Jewel felt almost embarrassed by the eminence to which
      her child was suddenly raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, thank you, Mrs. Forbes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;you needn't take so much trouble.
      Anna Belle's just used to having a part of mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But nothing now was too good for Anna Belle. &ldquo;She shall have a cup-custard
      to-morrow,&rdquo; returned the housekeeper.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked on with lack-lustre eyes. As well make much of Anna
      Belle as any other idol. Everything was stuffed with sawdust!
    </p>
    <p>
      How the sunbeams glanced in the woods that day as Jewel, one hand clasping
      her doll and the other in Eloise's, skipped along the road to the ravine!
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had stooped under the wire and gone down the bank, how the brook
      sang, and how the violets bloomed in Jewel's garden!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very pretty,&rdquo; said Eloise, regarding the paths and flower beds which
      Jewel exhibited with pride. &ldquo;It's very pretty, but it lacks one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What?&rdquo; asked the child eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A pond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it is by the side of a rushing river,&rdquo; returned Jewel.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but all the more easy to have a pond.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll set a shallow pan, and sink it in the ground, and plant ferns about
      it to hang over. Anna Belle can have some little china dolls to go in
      wading in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, yes!&rdquo; cried Jewel delighted. &ldquo;Hear that, dearie? Hear what Love
      is planning for you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anna Belle's nose was buried in the grass and her hat was awry. If she had
      a fault, it was a tendency to being overdressed. At present her plumed hat
      and large fluffy boa gave her an aspect unsympathetic with the
      surroundings. Jewel pulled her upright and placed her on the mossy divan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'd only brought the trowel I could get the hole ready,&rdquo; Jewel was
      saying, when a whistle, soft and clear as a flute, sounded above the
      brook's gurgle.
    </p>
    <p>
      She lifted a finger in caution. &ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; she whispered, looking up into her
      cousin's face, &ldquo;the loveliest bird! Hush.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Clear, sweet, flexible, somewhere among those high branches sounded again
      the same elaborate phrase.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel was surprised to see her cousin's pleased, listening expression
      alter to eager wonder, then the girl flushed rosy red and started up.
      &ldquo;Siegfried!&rdquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Again came the bird motif sifting down through the rustling leaves.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat!&rdquo; called Eloise gladly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Any nymphs down there?&rdquo; questioned a man's voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May Pan come down?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel, watching and wondering, saw a young man in light clothes swing
      himself down from tree to tree, and at last saw both his hands close on
      both her cousin's.
    </p>
    <p>
      The two talked and laughed in unison for a minute, then Eloise freed
      herself and turned to the serious-faced child. &ldquo;You remember my speaking
      of Nat the other day?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;This is he. Mr. Bonnell, this is my
      cousin Jewel Evringham. She is landscape gardening just now, and may not
      feel like giving you her hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can wash it,&rdquo; said Jewel, dipping the earthy member in the brook,
      wiping it on the grass, and placing it in the large one that was offered
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did you ever find us? I thought you'd gone back to New York. I had no
      idea of seeing you,&rdquo; said Eloise in a breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't your mother tell you? I have a week off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's bright face sobered. &ldquo;Poor mother! She had a&mdash;a shock
      after you were here yesterday. I suppose it put everything out of her
      head. Was it she who sent you to find us?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; a massive lady met me at the door and informed me that your mother
      wished to be excused from every one to-day, but that you had fallen down a
      crack in the earth which could be reached up this road.&rdquo; The speaker
      looked about. &ldquo;As there doesn't seem any place to stand here, hadn't we
      better sit down before we fall in the brook? I might rescue you, but the
      current is swift.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise at once sank upon the green incline, and he followed her example.
      Jewel watched him with consideration, and he became aware of her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you making, little girl?&rdquo; he asked, with his sunshiny smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A garden; and I could dig the pond if I had brought the trowel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps my knife will do.&rdquo; He took it out and opened the largest blade.
      &ldquo;What do you think of that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you suppose I should break it?&rdquo; asked the child doubtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You're welcome to try,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She leaned forward and accepted it from his outstretched hand.

      CHAPTER XXV
    </h2>
    <h3>
      MUTUAL SURPRISES
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I knew Bel-Air Park,&rdquo; said Bonnell looking about him. &ldquo;I never
      suspected this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel is the Columbus of this spot. She has named it the Ravine of
      Happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat looked at his speaker. &ldquo;That's rather ambiguous. Does she mean where
      happiness is buried or where it is found?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise smiled. &ldquo;Jewel never buries any happiness. Well, how is everybody,
      Nat? Your mother, first of all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Mrs. Evringham tell you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's face clouded with apprehension at his surprised tone. &ldquo;No. You
      will think it very strange, but poor mamma was under such excitement, you
      must pardon her. Everything went out of her head. Don't tell me that dear
      Mrs. Bonnell&rdquo;&mdash;she lowered her voice&mdash;&ldquo;that you have lost her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He shook his head. &ldquo;No, I've gained her. She's well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well!&rdquo; repeated the girl amazed. &ldquo;Why, what do you mean? How glorious!
      How long since?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About three months.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am so glad! Tell me more good news. Tell me about your own frivoling,
      and then I shall hear about the other people.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man shook his head. &ldquo;I observed Lent this year scrupulously, and
      I haven't changed my tactics since Easter. I've been keeping my nose to
      the grindstone. Began to see things a little differently, Eloise. I
      decided it was mother's innings&mdash;decided to drop the butterfly and do
      the bee act.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible!&rdquo; The girl laughed. &ldquo;Will wonders never cease! What was
      the matter? Did the heiresses cut you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cut the whole thing, and I have my reward. I suppose your mother didn't
      tell you that, either. I'm going into business with Mr. Reeves. Do you
      know him? Jewel does.&rdquo; He smiled toward the child, who lifted an
      interested face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You remember about him, cousin Eloise.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; The girl looked at her friend questioningly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm spending this week at his house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you know about Jewel? He has told you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly. The one person of his acquaintance who hasn't to unlearn
      anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean he talked to you of Christian Science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell's hands were clasping his knees. His hat lay on the bank beside
      him and the thick hair tossed away from his brow. He nodded slowly,
      wondering at the sudden attentive interest of her look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;We talked on the tabooed subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tabooed with whom? You?&rdquo; she asked disappointedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, with you I understand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Color flew into Eloise's face. &ldquo;Who told you that? Mother of course.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell nodded, giving a fleeting glance toward the child, who was again
      busy at her excavation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are congratulations in order, Eloise?&rdquo; he asked quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, congratulations.&rdquo; Her eyes grew full of light. &ldquo;For I have come to
      see the truth. That child has shown me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man's lips remained apart for a second in his surprise at this
      declaration, after Mrs. Evringham's detailed representations.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I may tell you how my mother was healed,&rdquo; he said at last.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, was it really so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you, Nat?&rdquo; Unconsciously Eloise leaned her whole body toward him,
      supporting her hand on the ground. &ldquo;You know about it yourself? You
      understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you believe in it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With all my heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face shone. &ldquo;Oh, Jewel, do you hear? Mr. Bonnell is a Scientist.&rdquo; The
      girl's breathing was hastened. Her eyes were like stars.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child sank back from her work and regarded the visitor, smiling. She
      was glad, but she was not astonished. In her world a great many young men
      had found the key to life, but to Eloise it was something wonderful. She
      looked at her old friend as if she had never seen him before. She reviewed
      all she knew of his gay life with its background of suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you study the lessons?&rdquo; she asked incredulously. &ldquo;<i>You</i>?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every day. I am surprised beyond measure to find you interested, for your
      mother told me&mdash;And the doctor&mdash;?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is a very fine man,&rdquo; returned Eloise gravely, as he paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell's mental questions were answered by her manner. He put his hand in
      the pocket of his sack coat and drew out a small, thin, black book.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise took it. &ldquo;'Unity of Good,'&rdquo; she read on its cover. &ldquo;I haven't seen
      this one,&rdquo; she said eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will,&rdquo; he replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up. &ldquo;Do you know, I thought just now you were going to take out
      your pipe?&rdquo; she said naively. &ldquo;That's where you used to keep it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My pipe doesn't like me any more,&rdquo; he rejoined quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you happy, Nat?&rdquo; she asked, scrutinizing his face with childlike,
      searching eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was never a very solemn codger, was I?&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But are you happier? Does the world look different? Of course it does,
      with your mother well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; he answered in a changed tone, tossing his head back, and making
      a gesture as of throwing away something. &ldquo;There was nothing in it before,
      nothing in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, yes, I know,&rdquo; she returned comprehendingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel had watched them, and now, as they paused, her voice broke the
      silence in which the two friends looked into each other's faces.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cousin Eloise is going to church with me on Sunday,&rdquo; she announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, certainly.&rdquo; Bonnell smiled. &ldquo;Wednesday evening meetings and all now,
      Eloise. Haven't you attended yet?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I've only just learned. I've only just seen. I'm only beginning to
      see, Nat. Your mother was healed. Oh, it is <i>true</i>, isn't it! It's so
      wonderful to find that you, <i>you</i>, know more about it than I do, when
      I supposed you would scorn it. I can't help expecting to wake up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is just what you will do,&rdquo; returned Bonnell. &ldquo;You will waken&mdash;to
      a thousand things. So your mother objects.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little mother,&rdquo; returned Eloise, looking down with sudden sadness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My mother wants you and yours to make us a long visit at View Point this
      summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's lovely eyes raised hopefully. &ldquo;The best thing that could
      happen,&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so,&rdquo; responded her companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Mr. Evringham returned from golf that afternoon, only his
      daughter-in-law was in sight. She inclined her head toward him with the
      air of a Lady Macbeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you seen anything of the girls?&rdquo; she asked as he approached her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing. Where are they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She slowly shrugged her shoulders. &ldquo;I'm the last one to ask. They wouldn't
      think of telling me,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's up now?&rdquo; thought Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;You don't look well, Madge,&rdquo; he
      said aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once she would have welcomed the evidence of solicitude. Now nothing
      mattered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't feel well,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;and I can't even call the physician I
      prefer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham stared down at her for a silent minute, and light broke upon
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it all off with Ballard?&rdquo; he asked bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; and that's what you have done, father, by allowing that child Jewel
      to come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham bit his lip. This amused him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloise has mounted the new hobby, and is riding for dear life away from
      common sense, away from everything that promised such happiness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean Christian Science?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a strange thing, Madge. Do you know, it captures people with good
      heads.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham seated himself near his daughter's chair. &ldquo;I came
      out on the train with my friend Reeves. He was talking about young
      Bonnell, of whom you spoke last night. Said his mother was cured when the
      doctors couldn't do anything. You know her, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As well as if she were my own flesh and blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it a fact, what they say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was considered incurable. I know nothing about the rest of it. Nat
      was telling me yesterday. Now he is probably infatuated also, and, sooner
      or later, Eloise is sure to meet him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm, h'm. An old flame, you said,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;Indeed! In&mdash;deed!
      I trust for your sake, Madge, that his is not objectionable to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is,&rdquo; snapped Mrs. Evringham. &ldquo;A poor fellow, with his way to make in
      the world. He's been out of college a couple of years and hasn't done
      anything worth speaking of yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Reeves is going to take him into the business,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham.
      &ldquo;I don't know why or wherefore, but the mere fact is decidedly promising.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, who can tell if that will last!&rdquo; returned the other with scornful
      pessimism. &ldquo;Nat has let too many cotillions to do anything else well. I
      can only pray that he will get away without seeing Eloise. Mrs. Bonnell
      has invited us to make her a visit this summer. I certainly shall not go
      one step!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sudden sound of laughter was heard on the quiet air. Mrs. Evringham
      leaned forward. &ldquo;There are the children now,&rdquo; she said, as figures turned
      in at the gateway; &ldquo;and who is that? It is&rdquo;&mdash;with desperation,&mdash;&ldquo;he's
      here! Nat Bonnell is with them!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat upright with disapproval, clasping the arm of her chair, while her
      father-in-law looked curiously at the approaching group. His gaze fixed on
      the young man with the well-set head who, swinging his hat in his hand,
      was talking fast to Eloise of something that amused them both. Jewel
      apparently interrupted him and he stooped with a quick motion, and in a
      second she was sitting on his shoulder, shrieking in gleeful surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus they approached the piazza and came close before noting that it was
      occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, see me!&rdquo; cried Jewel delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell met the unsmiling gaze of his host as Mr. Evringham rose, and then
      caught sight of Mrs. Evringham stonily gazing from her chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, how do you do?&rdquo; he called laughingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jove, he is a good looking chap!&rdquo; thought the host, and Bonnell set Jewel
      down at his feet with such velocity that Anna Belle was cast heavily to
      earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A thousand pardons!&rdquo; exclaimed Nat, catching up the doll by the skirt and
      restoring her.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel gave him a bright look. &ldquo;<i>She</i> knows there is no sensation in
      matter,&rdquo; she said scornfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor Anna Belle! The topography of the ravine was full of hazards for her,
      and her seasons there were always so adventurous and full of sudden and
      unlooked-for bumps that her philosophy was well tested, and she might
      reasonably have complained of this gratuitous blow; but she smiled on, as
      Jewel hugged her. Her mental poise was marvelous, whatever might be said
      of the physical.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise introduced her friend and went to her mother's side, while Bonnell
      shook hands with Mr. Evringham and exchanged some words concerning Mr.
      Reeves and business matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wide awake,&rdquo; was the older man's mental comment. &ldquo;Doesn't seem at all the
      sort of person to be fooled about that healing business. Good eye. Good
      manner. Perhaps this was Ballard's handicap all the time. I guess you're
      in for it, Madge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nat moved to greet Mrs. Evringham, who gave him no welcoming smile. She
      leaned back listlessly, not caring what effect she produced. He seemed to
      her a part of the combination entered into by the Fates to thwart and
      annoy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell knew her nearly as well as Eloise did. &ldquo;I'm sorry you're under the
      weather,&rdquo; he said sympathetically, when he had discovered that, in his own
      phrase, there was &ldquo;nothing doing.&rdquo; &ldquo;I received a letter from my mother
      to-day, in which she impressed upon me that she expected you both by the
      middle of June.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My plans have changed since yesterday, Nat,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham
      dismally. &ldquo;Yes. We shall not be able to go to your mother's, as I had
      hoped. Some time during the season I shall try to look in on her of
      course. You tell her so, Nat, when you write.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, nonsense, Mrs. Evringham. You don't in the least mean it,&rdquo; he
      returned cheerfully, with the smile and manner which she could not and
      would not endure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do mean it, Nat. I tell you my plans are changed. Eloise and I may go
      to Europe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Naturally she had never thought of Europe until that moment, but that
      laughing, caressing light in Nat Bonnell's eyes was insufferable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, in that case, of course,&rdquo; he returned, &ldquo;we couldn't say a word,&rdquo; and
      then he moved to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham urged the visitor to stay to dinner, but he declined and
      once more shook hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Jewel,&rdquo; he said to the child. &ldquo;Sunday, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes indeed, I know,&rdquo; she returned, an irresistible tendency to hop moving
      her feet. On nearer acquaintance she had found Mr. Bonnell exhilarating.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-by, Nat,&rdquo; said Eloise.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked into the face on which rested a cloud. &ldquo;I think you might be a
      degree more attentive,&rdquo; he suggested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh&mdash;take me to the gate, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise smiled and went with him. He turned with a slight bow that included
      the group, and they strolled down the path.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all up, Madge,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Evringham, half smiling. &ldquo;No use
      wriggling, no use staying away from the mother. Might as well yield
      gracefully. I think Ballard might have been told, that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing to tell, father! How can you be so unkind? That's just
      Nat's manner. He is used to everybody liking him, and always having his
      own way; but Eloise never&mdash;she <i>never</i>&rdquo;&mdash;the speaker saw
      that if she continued, in a moment more she would be weeping, and she
      certainly was not going to weep in this company. So she contented herself
      by glaring toward the gate, where could be seen two figures in earnest
      conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had counted so much on Mrs. Bonnell's influence,&rdquo; Eloise was saying.
      &ldquo;What does mother mean? She knows my mind is made up as to Christian
      Science. What is she afraid of?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Bonnell caught his thumbs in his coat pockets and lifted himself slightly
      on his toes. &ldquo;She is afraid of me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of you?&rdquo; The girl lifted surprised eyes to his and let them fall again,
      her grave face coloring.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She has always been more or less afraid of me. I'm ineligible, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you are, awfully, Nat,&rdquo; returned Eloise earnestly. &ldquo;That's what
      makes you so nice. Didn't we always have a good time together?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on those rare occasions when we had a chance, but Mrs. Evringham
      always suspected me. She never felt certain that I wasn't waiting for your
      skirts to be lengthened and your hair to go up in order to steal you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise tried to look at him, but found it more comfortable to examine the
      inexpressive gravel path. &ldquo;But now you have something to think of besides
      girls,&rdquo; she said gently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Do you know, Eloise, if I had been promised the granting of one wish
      as I took the cars for Bel-Air, it would have been that I might find you
      convinced of the truth of Christian Science.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She looked at him now brightly, gladly. &ldquo;It is such a help to me to know
      that you are in it,&rdquo; she returned. Their hands simultaneously went forth
      and clasped. &ldquo;What shall we do about mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He smiled. &ldquo;That will all come right,&rdquo; he returned confidently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There are classes, Nat,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Have you been through one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet. Perhaps we could enter together.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so?&rdquo; she returned eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was looking down at her still&mdash;calm, strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      She started. &ldquo;I mustn't be late to dinner. Good-by. Sunday, Nat.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to-morrow? I want some golf.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, go. It's a fine links. I'm sorry, but I'd better not go there for
      the present. Good-by.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She was gone, so he strolled on and out through the park, and as he went
      he put two and two together, and suspected the cause of the girl's
      objection to golf.

      CHAPTER XXVI
    </h2>
    <h3>
      ON WEDNESDAY EVENING
    </h3>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is my silk dress, grandpa,&rdquo; said Jewel, coming out on the piazza
      Sunday morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham was sitting there reading the paper. He looked up to behold
      his granddaughter standing expectantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had on the cherished frock. Her plump black legs ended in new shoes,
      the brim of her large hat was wreathed with daisies, snowy ribbons
      finished her well-brushed braids, while, happiest touch of all, Little
      Faithful was ticking away on her breast.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, who is this bonnie lassie?&rdquo; asked Mr. Evringham, viewing her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my best one,&rdquo; said Jewel, smilingly, coming close to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should hope so. If you were anything grander I should have to put on
      smoked glasses to look at you. Church, eh?&rdquo; He took the brown pamphlet she
      carried and examined it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I wish you were coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have an important engagement at the golf club this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you? Well, grandpa, I was thinking you can't play golf or ride at
      night, and wouldn't you take me Wednesday evening?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Church.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Heavens, child! Wednesday evening prayer meeting?&rdquo; asked the broker in
      perturbation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. It's just lovely reading and singing and interesting stories,&rdquo;
       replied Jewel, endeavoring to paint the picture as attractively as
      possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. H'm. Do you suppose Mr. Reeves goes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course,&rdquo; replied the child. &ldquo;Scientists never stay away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then should I be considered a Scientist if I went? I still have some
      regard for my reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A great many visitors go,&rdquo; replied the child earnestly. Then she added,
      with unmistakably sincere naivete, &ldquo;I don't mind leaving you in the
      daytime, because we're used to it; but I was thinking it would make me
      homesick, grandpa, to go away in the evening and leave you in the
      library.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham took her little hand in his. &ldquo;Have you thought, Jewel,&rdquo; he
      asked, &ldquo;how it will be when you leave me altogether?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall have mother and father then,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but whom shall I have?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The question came curtly, and Jewel looked into the deep-set eyes in
      surprise. &ldquo;Shall you miss me, grandpa?&rdquo; she asked wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whom shall I have, I say?&rdquo; he repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The child thought a minute. &ldquo;Just who you had before,&rdquo; she answered,
      slipping her arm around his neck. &ldquo;There's Essex Maid, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker gave a short laugh. &ldquo;Yes. It's lucky, isn't it?&rdquo; he returned,
      rather bitterly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you like to have me with you, grandpa?&rdquo; pursued the child, pleased.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; confound it, Jewel, yes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then Divine Love will fix it somehow, for I love to be with you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do, eh? Then I'll tell you that I received a letter from your father
      yesterday. It was a very pleasant letter, but it said they felt obliged,
      if they could, to stay over a little longer&mdash;two or three weeks
      longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child's face grew thoughtful.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said they had just received your letter, and were very pleased and
      thankful to know that you were happy. He said it would be a business
      advantage to them to stay, but that they could come home at the appointed
      time if you wished it. I am to cable them to-morrow, if you do.&rdquo; Silence
      for a minute while Jewel thought. &ldquo;Do you think you can be happy with me a
      little longer than you expected?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I do want to see mother and father very much,&rdquo; returned the child, &ldquo;but
      I'm just as happy as anything,&rdquo; she added heartily, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham had listened with surprising anxiety for the verdict. &ldquo;Very
      well, very well,&rdquo; he returned, with extra brusqueness, picking up his
      newspaper. &ldquo;I guess there won't be anything to prevent my going to that
      meeting with you Wednesday evening, Jewel. Just once, you understand, once
      only.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment the brougham drove around to the steps, and Eloise came out
      upon the piazza. She was a vision of dainty purity in her white gown,
      white hat, and gloves.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham rose, lifted his hat, and going down the steps opened the
      door of the carriage. &ldquo;A man need not be ashamed to have these two ladies
      represent him at church,&rdquo; he said, looking into Eloise's calm eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      She smiled back at him. There was no suspicion now of sarcasm or stings.
      The air she breathed was wholesome and inviting. The lump had been
      leavened.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the hall where the services were held, the girls were ushered
      into good seats before the room rapidly filled.
    </p>
    <p>
      They saw Mr. Reeves and his family and Mr. Bonnell come in on the other
      side, and the latter did not rest until he had found them and sent over a
      bright, quick nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      The platform was beautiful by a tall vase of roses at the side of the
      white reading-desk, and Eloise listened eagerly to the voices of the man
      and woman who alternately read the morning lesson. The peace, simplicity,
      and quiet of the service enthralled her. She looked over the crowd of
      listening, reverent faces with wistful wonder. Nat was among them, <i>Nat</i>!
      Sometimes she glanced across at his attentive face. Nat at church, in the
      morning; thoroughly interested! She pinched her arm to make quite certain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once when they rose to sing, it was the hymn she had heard. The voices
      swelled:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;O'er waiting harpstrings of the mind
     There sweeps a strain,
     Low, sad, and sweet, whose measures bind
     The power of pain.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The girl in the white dress did not sing. She swallowed often. The voice
      of the child at her side soared easily.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;And o'er earth's troubled, angry sea,
     I see Christ walk;
     And come to me, and tenderly,
     Divinely, talk.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      What a haven of promise and peace seemed this sunny, simple place of
      purity.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;From tired joy and grief afar,
     And nearer Thee,
     Father, where Thine own children are
     I love to be.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      Jewel, looking up at her companion, was surprised to see her lashes wet
      and her lower lip caught between her teeth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, cousin Eloise?&rdquo; she whispered softly as they sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl tried to smile. Words were not at her command. &ldquo;Gladness,&rdquo; she
      returned briefly; which reply caused Jewel to meditate for some time.
    </p>
    <p>
      They had a talk with Nat and were presented to the Reeves family after
      church, and Eloise felt herself in an atmosphere of love.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel left the group for a private word to Zeke before her cousin should
      come to enter the brougham. 'Zekiel sat bolt upright in the most approved
      style, and did not turn his face, even when the child addressed him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been wondering this morning,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;how we can manage for you
      to come to church, 'Zekiel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I have it six times a week,&rdquo; returned the coachman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But it's so lovely just to listen to them read and not have to hunt up
      the places or anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm satisfied with my minister,&rdquo; returned Zeke, almost smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise and Mr. Bonnell came out to the carriage, so there was no further
      time for talk.
    </p>
    <p>
      The subject remained in Jewel's mind, however. On Wednesday morning, just
      before Mr. Evringham went to the station, the child seized him in the
      hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, don't you think it would be nice to go in the trolley car to
      church to-night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To&mdash;where?&rdquo; asked the broker, frowning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the night we're going to church, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The dev&mdash;Ah, to be sure. So we are. Well&mdash;a&mdash;what did you
      say? Trolley car? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we could all go then, you know,&rdquo; returned Jewel. &ldquo;Cousin Eloise
      wants to go, but,&rdquo; the child's honesty compelled her, &ldquo;she wouldn't have
      to go with us because it is Mr. Bonnell's last night in Bel-Air, and I
      heard him ask if he might come for her; but I do so want Zeke to go,
      grandpa!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, for the love of&rdquo;&mdash;began the broker slowly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Zeke is getting to understand a good deal about Christian Science.
      He has some claims of error that his mother knows about, and they make her
      sorry, and I've been helping him and reading to him out of my books, and I
      do want him to go to the testimonial meeting so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child looked wistfully up into the dark eyes that rested upon her. Mr.
      Evringham had remarked his housekeeper's change of spirit toward the
      little girl, had wondered at the increasing and even reckless indulgence
      of Anna Belle, who from being an exile in the stair closet had now arrived
      at a degree of consideration and pampering which threatened to turn her
      head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel,&rdquo; he said impressively, &ldquo;I wish you to understand one thing
      distinctly. You are not now or at any future time to try to make a
      Christian Scientist of Essex Maid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      From wondering sobriety Jewel's lips broke into a gleeful smile. &ldquo;I don't
      have to,&rdquo; she cried triumphantly. &ldquo;She is one! Anyway, she has
      demonstrated everything a horse ought to!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham flung his hands over his head despairingly. &ldquo;Great heavens!&rdquo;
       he exclaimed tragically, rushing out to the brougham, Jewel at his heels
      in peals of laughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      But they went to church in the trolley car. Eloise reached the same place
      with Mr. Bonnell, but whether she walked or drove or rode nobody ever
      knew, and it didn't matter much, for a full moon illumined the night.
    </p>
    <p>
      Early in the evening a young man entered the hall quietly and took a back
      seat. It was Zeke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reeves saw Jewel and her grandfather come in, and softly he smote his
      knee. &ldquo;She's done it!&rdquo; he ejaculated mentally. He noted the broker's
      haughty carriage, the half challenging glances he threw to right and left
      as he proceeded up the aisle to the position of Jewel's choice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Reeves composed his countenance with some difficulty, and catching the
      wandering eye, gave his friend a grave bow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Testimonial meetings differ in point of continued interest. This proved to
      be a good one. The most interesting narrative of the evening was Nat
      Bonnell's. His self possession, fine presence, and good voice made more
      effective the marvelous story of his mother's resurrection to strength. He
      told it with dignity and directness, and Mr. Evringham was impressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's my rheumatism to that, eh, Jewel?&rdquo; he whispered, as Nat sat down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just nothing, grandpa,&rdquo; replied the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think the Creator'd consider me worth attending to, eh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God doesn't know you have the rheumatism,&rdquo; exclaimed Jewel with soft
      scorn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't? Well! I've always supposed He thought I needed reminding on
      account of a number of things, and so touched me up with that. I didn't
      blame Him much.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If He knew it, it would be real, and then it couldn't be changed,&rdquo;
       returned Jewel earnestly in the ear he bent to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker sat up and looked down on her large hat and short legs. &ldquo;Whew,
      but I'm a back number!&rdquo; he mused.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next testimonial made Jewel's eyes brighten. It was given by a man who
      told a story of hopeless intemperance and his family's want. The
      unaffected humility and gratitude that sounded in his voice as he
      described the changed conditions which followed his cure caused the roses
      to deepen in Jewel's cheeks. She wondered where Zeke was sitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Altogether she was happy over the meeting, and her grandfather's attitude
      was as kindly as could have been expected.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise came into her mother's room that night, beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you had come with us,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It was wonderful.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham turned to her with a lofty air. &ldquo;I have too much loyalty to
      friendship to be seen in such a place,&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nat said he wouldn't ask you to come down to bid him good-by, because he
      expects to come out to spend Sundays for a while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked at her daughter. All the girl's face had lacked of
      vivacity and happy expression it wore now, making her radiant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You could never guess the news I have for you, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham's lips tightened. &ldquo;Eloise, if you will not marry the fine
      man who had my entire approval, it will be outrageous for you to marry an
      ineligible, a young fellow whose goods are all in the show window, who has
      not proved himself in any way. I refuse to hear your news,&rdquo; she returned
      impetuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      The girl laughed. &ldquo;Do you mean Nat, dear?&rdquo; she asked, her rosy face coming
      close. &ldquo;I'm afraid he's going to spoil himself by becoming eligible. He
      has been telling me a lot about the business to-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ho! Nat Bonnell could always talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise's arms closed around her. &ldquo;There's only one source of supply,
      mother. Nat has found Him. I am finding Him. We shall not want. What do
      you think I have here for you? Grandfather gave it to me.&rdquo; Eloise put into
      her mother's hands a draft for a thousand dollars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham appeared to lose sight of the dagger she had been seeing
      before her for days. &ldquo;What is this?&rdquo; she ejaculated. &ldquo;A present from
      father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all. Some unknown man owed it to papa, and his conscience made him
      pay the debt. It came in grandfather's evening mail, and he has only just
      opened it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham examined the paper eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How wonderful!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How natural,&rdquo; returned Eloise. &ldquo;That is the wonderful part of it.&rdquo;
     </p>

      CHAPTER XXVII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      A REALIZED HOPE
    </h3>
    <p>
      One afternoon Mr. Evringham did not return from the city at the usual
      time. Jewel, watching for him, was surprised after a while to see him
      walking up from the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what's happened?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;Zeke went for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; but he found he had to leave Dick to be shod.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then are you going to saddle Essex Maid yourself? Oh, can I see you do
      it, grandpa?&rdquo; She hopped with anticipation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that I'll ride just now. It's an excellent day for walking.
      It seems rather strange to me, Jewel, that you've never shown me the
      Ravine of Happiness. You talk a good deal about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, would you like to come?&rdquo; cried the child, flushing. &ldquo;Good! I have the
      pond all fixed in Anna Belle's garden, and the ferns droop over it just
      like a fairy story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you put up a sign for the fairies to keep out?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No&mdash;o,&rdquo; returned Jewel, drawing in her chin and smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh well, you may be sure they're at it, then, every moonlight night. They
      haven't a particle of respect, you know, for anything. If I were in Anna
      Belle's place, I should put up a sign, 'Private Grounds.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she's so unselfish she wouldn't. If they only won't break the flowers
      she won't care,&rdquo; returned the child, entering into the fancy with zest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham took the doll from her arms, and carrying it up the steps
      deposited it in the piazza chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Isn't she going?&rdquo; asked Jewel soberly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not this time. She doesn't care, she's been there so much. Just see
      how cheerful and comfortable she looks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was, indeed, a smile of almost cloying sweetness on Anna Belle's
      countenance, and she seemed to be seeing pleasing visions.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never saw such a good child!&rdquo; said Jewel with an admiring sigh; then
      she put her hand in her grandfather's and they strolled out into the park
      and up the shady road. Just before reaching the bend around which lay the
      gorge, Mr. Evringham surprised his companion by breaking in upon her
      lively chatter with a tune which he whistled loudly.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was such an unusual ebullition that Jewel looked up at him. &ldquo;Why,
      grandpa, I never heard you whistle before,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't? That's because you never before saw me out on a lark. I tell
      you, I'm a gay one when I get started,&rdquo; and forthwith there burst again
      from his lips a gay refrain, that sounded shrilly up the leafy path. They
      rounded the bend in the road, and the broker looked down into the eyes
      that were bent upon him in admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You whistle almost as well as Mr. Bonnell,&rdquo; said the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Give me time and I dare say I shall beat him out,&rdquo; was the swaggering
      response. &ldquo;Ah, here's your ravine, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's&rdquo;&mdash;began Jewel, and went no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      A couple of rods from where she suddenly came to a standstill was an
      object which for a moment rooted her to the spot. A small horse, black as
      jet, with a white star in his forehead and a flowing, wavy mane and tail,
      stood by the roadside. His coat, gleaming like satin, set off the pure
      white leather of his trappings. On his back was fastened a side saddle,
      and he was tethered to the rail of the light fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham appeared not to see him. He was looking down the rocks and
      grass of the steep incline.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is there any sort of a path?&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;or do you descend it as you
      would a cellar door? I think you might have told me, so I could change
      these light trousers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; exclaimed Jewel in a hushed tone, pointing before her. &ldquo;See
      that horse&mdash;just like the coal black steed the princess rides in a
      fairy story.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, that's so. He is a beauty. Where do you suppose the princess is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's probably gone down the ravine,&rdquo; returned the child, her feet drawn
      forward as if by a magnet. &ldquo;Let's not go down yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker allowed himself to be led close to the pony, who turned his
      full bright eyes upon the pair curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think I might touch him, grandpa?&rdquo; asked the child, still in the
      hushed voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he's a fairy horse he might vanish,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;Let's
      see how he stands it.&rdquo; So saying he gave the shining flank some sturdy
      love pats. &ldquo;Oh, he's all right. He's good substantial flesh and blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the lady,&rdquo; said Jewel, looking about, the pupils of her eyes dilated
      with excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't think a very big lady has been riding in that saddle. You can
      do as you'd be done by, I fancy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Upon this Jewel stroked the pony over and over lovingly, and he nosed
      about her in a friendly way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, see him, see him! And oh grandpa, see his beautiful star, white
      as a snowflake!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, upon my word, if this isn't lucky,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Evringham. &ldquo;Here
      is some sugar in my pocket, now.&rdquo; He passed some lumps to the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it be right?&rdquo; she asked, glancing down the ravine. &ldquo;Had I better
      wait till the girl comes up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She won't mind, I'll wager,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham; so the child, thus
      encouraged, fed the coal black steed, who, for all his poetical
      appearance, had evidently a strongly developed sweet tooth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hello, what's this!&rdquo; exclaimed the broker, stepping to the fence and
      taking up something black and folded. When he shook it out, it proved to
      be a child's riding skirt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's left it there,&rdquo; said Jewel eagerly. &ldquo;We ought not to touch it. It's
      very hard on clothes going down the ravine, and she's left it there. Don't
      you think, grandpa, you <i>ought</i> to put it back?&rdquo; for to her great
      surprise her punctilious and particular relative was shaking the fine
      skirt about recklessly and examining it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here's a name,&rdquo; he said, bringing his prize to Jewel and showing her an
      oblong bit of white cloth, much as tailors use inside dresses. &ldquo;What do
      you make of it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child, disturbed by such daring, and dreading to see the owner of
      these splendid possessions scramble up the bank, looked reluctantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      The name was a long one, but so familiar that she recognized it at once.
      &ldquo;Evringham.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her eyes to her grandfather. &ldquo;It's the same as ours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There isn't another Evringham in Bel-Air,&rdquo; returned the broker. &ldquo;The
      fairies dropped this for you, I guess, Jewel. It certainly won't fit me.
      Let's try it on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He slipped it over the head of the dazed child and hooked it around her
      waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'It fitted her exactly,'&rdquo; murmured Jewel. &ldquo;They always say so in fairy
      stories.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here,&rdquo; said her grandfather. He put his hand into the stirrup and
      drew out a folded bit of paper. He handed it to the child, who began to
      wonder if she was dreaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      DEAR JEWEL (she read),&mdash;I believe you expected Divine Love to send
      you a horse. I have come to belong to you, and my name is STAR.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was astonishing what a large, round penmanship the pony possessed.
      There was no possibility of mistaking a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel read the note over twice as she stood there, the long, scant skirt,
      making her look tall. Mr. Evringham stood watching her. His part in the
      comedy was played. He waited.
    </p>
    <p>
      She looked up at him with eyes that seemed trying to comprehend a fact too
      large.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, have you given me this horse?&rdquo; she asked solemnly, and he could
      see her hands beginning to tremble.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, am <i>I</i> to get some credit for this?&rdquo; returned the broker,
      smiling and twisting his mustache. &ldquo;I didn't expect that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He knew her lack of motion would not last long, and was bracing himself
      for the attack when, to his surprise, she pulled up the impeding skirt and
      made a rush, not for him, but for the pony. Hiding her face on the
      creature's satin shoulder, she flung her arm around his throat, and
      seizing his rippling mane, sobbed as if her heart would break.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham had not spent weeks in selecting and testing a horse for his
      granddaughter without choosing one whose nervous system would be proof
      against sudden assaults of affection; but this onslaught was so energetic
      that the pony tossed his head and backed to the end of his tether.
    </p>
    <p>
      His new mistress stumbled after him, her face still hidden. She was trying
      heroically to stifle the sobs that were shaking her from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jewel, Jewel, child!&rdquo; ejaculated her grandfather, much dismayed. &ldquo;Come,
      come, what's this?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He drew her with a strong hand, and she deserted the pony, much to the
      latter's relief, and clasping Mr. Evringham as high up as she could reach,
      began bedewing his vest buttons with her tears.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, gra&mdash;grandpa, I c&mdash;can't have him!&rdquo; she sobbed. &ldquo;There
      isn't any roo&mdash;room for him in our&mdash;our fla&mdash;fla&mdash;flat!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, did you expect to keep him in the flat?&rdquo; inquired Mr. Evringham,
      stooping tenderly, his own eyes shining suspiciously, as he put his arms
      around the little shaking form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;N&mdash;no; but we&mdash;we haven't any bar&mdash;barn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The broker smiled above the voluminous, quivering bows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, hasn't some good livery man in your neighborhood a stable?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ye&mdash;yes.&rdquo; Jewel made greater efforts to stop crying. &ldquo;But I&mdash;I
      talked with mo&mdash;mother once about cou&mdash;could I ha&mdash;have a
      horse sometime before I grew up, and she said she might buy the horse, but
      it would cost so much&mdash;much money every week to board it, it would be
      error.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham patted the heaving shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but you don't know yet all about your horse. In some respects I've
      never seen a pony like him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I never have,&rdquo; returned the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, but you'll be surprised at <i>this</i>. This pony has a bank
      account.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel slowly grew quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody has to pay for <i>his</i> board and clothes. He is very
      independent. He would have it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; came in muffled tones from the broker's vest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So don't you think you'd better cheer up and look at him once more, and
      tell him you won't cry on his shoulder very often?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a minute Jewel looked up, revealing her swollen eyes. &ldquo;I'm ashamed,&rdquo;
       she said softly, &ldquo;but he was&mdash;so&mdash;be&mdash;<i>autiful</i>&mdash;I
      forgot to remember.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess you did forget to remember,&rdquo; returned Mr. Evringham,
      shaking his head and leading the child to her pony's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lifted her into the saddle and arranged her skirt, brushing away the
      dust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa!&rdquo; she exclaimed softly, with a long, quivering sigh, &ldquo;I'm so <i>happy</i>!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have you ever ridden, Jewel?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, a thousand times,&rdquo; she answered quickly; &ldquo;but not on a real
      horse,&rdquo; she added as an afterthought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. That might make a difference.&rdquo; Mr. Evringham loosed the pony and put
      the white bridle in the child's hands; then he led the pretty creature
      down the woodland road.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm <i>so</i> happy,&rdquo; repeated Jewel. &ldquo;What will mother and father say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll be a regular circus rider by the time they come home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As the broker spoke these words Zeke appeared around the bend in the road,
      riding Essex Maid. His face was alight with interest in the sight that met
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jewel called to him radiantly. &ldquo;Oh, Zeke, what do you think?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it's great,&rdquo; he responded. &ldquo;Hello, little kid,&rdquo; he said, as he
      came nearer and perceived the signs in the child's face. &ldquo;Pony do any
      harm, Mr. Evringham?&rdquo; he asked with respectful concern.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Jewel cried a little, but it was only because I told her she could
      not sleep nights in Star's manger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child gave one look of astonishment at the speaker's grave
      countenance, and then shouted with a laugh as spontaneous as though no
      tear had ever fallen from her shining eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See Essex Maid look at my pony, grandpa!&rdquo; she said joyously. &ldquo;She looks
      so proud and stuck <i>up</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look away, my lady,&rdquo; said the broker. &ldquo;You'll see a great deal more of
      this young spring before you see less.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Zeke dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now then,&rdquo; Mr. Evringham looked up at the child. &ldquo;I'm going to let go
      your bridle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want you to,&rdquo; she answered gayly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham mounted his horse. &ldquo;We'll take a sedate walk through the
      woods,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Zeke, you might lead her a little way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, <i>please</i>,&rdquo; begged the child. &ldquo;I know how to ride. I <i>do</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let her go then,&rdquo; smiled the broker, and Essex Maid trotted slowly,
      noting with haughty bright eyes the little black companion, who might have
      stepped out of a picture book, but whose easy canter was tossing Jewel at
      every step.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't&mdash;any&mdash;whip!&rdquo; The words were bounced out of the
      child's lips, and Mr. Evringham's laugh resounded along the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe she'd use it,&rdquo; he said to Zeke, who was running along beside
      the black pony.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess she would, sir,&rdquo; grinned the young fellow responsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not many days before Jewel had learned to stay in the saddle. She
      had an efficient teacher who worked with her <i>con amore</i>, and the
      sight of the erect, gray-haired man on his famous mare, always accompanied
      by the rosy little girl on a black pony, came to be a familiar sight in
      Bel-Air, and one which people always turned to follow with their eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eloise had her talk with Mr. Evringham one evening when Jewel was excluded
      from the library, and she emerged from the interview with a more contented
      heart than she had known for a year.
    </p>
    <p>
      She endeavored to convey the situation to her mother in detail, but when
      that lady had learned that there were no happy surprises, she declined to
      listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tastes differ, Eloise,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am one who believes that where
      ignorance is bliss 'tis folly to be wise.&rdquo; Mrs. Evringham had regained a
      quite light-hearted appearance in the interest of expending a portion of
      her windfall on her own and Eloise's summer wardrobe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you shan't be bothered then,&rdquo; returned her daughter. &ldquo;You have me
      to take care of our money matters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I prefer to let father do it,&rdquo; returned Mrs. Evringham decidedly. &ldquo;He is
      a changed being of late, and we are as well situated as we could hope to
      be. I don't feel quite satisfied with the lining of the brougham, but some
      day I mean to speak of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Eloise threw up both hands, but she laughed. She and her grandfather had
      an excellent understanding, and she knew that the mills of the gods were
      about to grind.
    </p>
    <p>
      One evening the broker called his daughter-in-law into the library.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope it isn't on business,&rdquo; she remarked flippantly as she entered. &ldquo;I
      tell you right at the start, father, I can't understand it.&rdquo; Her eyes
      wandered about the room curiously. It was strange to her. She took up a
      woman's picture from the desk. &ldquo;Who is this?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do you like the face?&rdquo; he returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The dark eyes and sweet mouth looked back at her. She frowned slightly.
      She did not like the situation in which she had found the photograph. It
      was far too intimate for a stranger, and made her a little nervous.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If he is going to marry again, then good-by indeed!&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think it is rather sentimental,&rdquo; she returned, with an air of engaging
      candor, &ldquo;don't you? Just my first impression, you know; but it's a face I
      shouldn't trust. Who is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is Jewel's mother,&rdquo; returned the broker quietly, &ldquo;my daughter Julia.
      Jewel brought it down last night, also a lot of little letters her mother
      had put in the pockets of the child's dresses when she packed them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Evringham triumphantly. &ldquo;Didn't I say she was
      sentimental? About that sort of thing my perceptions are always so keen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;H'm. I read the letters, and I judged from them that one can trust her.
      Will you be seated?&rdquo; He placed a chair. &ldquo;I should like to ask your plans
      for the summer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham looked up quickly, startled. &ldquo;Oh, I haven't any. Have you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I always seek some cool spot. You have an invitation to View Point,
      I understand. You could scarcely do better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have reasons, father,&rdquo; impressively, &ldquo;reasons for declining that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then where are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I would just as lief stay here and take care of your house as not,&rdquo;
       declared the lady magnanimously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ha! Without any servants?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, what do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are going away for a vacation. I am intending to have the house
      wired, and Mrs. Forbes and Zeke will hold sway in the barn. She doesn't
      wish to leave him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham was silenced and dismayed. She felt herself being firmly
      and inexorably pushed out of this well-lined nest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her eyes fell before the impenetrable ones regarding her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How did Jewel ever win him?&rdquo; she thought. The picturesque pony, with his
      arched neck and expensive trappings, had outraged her feelings for days.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;About the View Point plan,&rdquo; continued Mr. Evringham deliberately. &ldquo;I
      think there are influences waiting for you there that will be of benefit.
      There is a new philosophy percolating in these days through our worldly
      rubbish which you and I would be the better for grasping. Your chances are
      better than mine, for you are young still. Your daughter is expanding like
      a flower already, in the first rays of her understanding of it. This young
      man whom you fancy you can avoid is a help to her. Mr. Reeves was talking
      to me about him last night. He says that so far as his business is
      concerned, young Bonnell is proving the square peg in the square hole. I
      don't know what Eloise's sentiments are toward him, but I do know that she
      shall be independent of any one's financial help but mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Evringham lifted her eyes hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall eke out the little income which is left to you with sufficient
      for you to live&mdash;not as you have done&mdash;but comfortably.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eager light faded from his listener's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eloise and I have arranged that,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;and she is satisfied.
      Take my advice, Madge. Go to View Point.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Eloise doesn't need horses so long as Jewel has them,&rdquo; said
      Mrs. Evringham rising.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her host followed her example. &ldquo;She thinks not,&rdquo; he returned concisely;
      then he opened the library door, and his daughter-in-law swept from his
      presence with all the dignity she could muster.

      CHAPTER XXVIII
    </h2>
    <h3>
      AT TWILIGHT
    </h3>
    <p>
      It was Sunday, and Mr. Bonnell was dining at Bel-Air Park. Had Jewel
      thought of it, she might have contrasted the expression of Mrs. Forbes's
      face as she waited at table this evening with the look it wore on the day
      she first arrived; might have noted the cheerful flow of talk which
      enlivened the board, in distinction from the stiff silence or bitter
      repartee which once chilled her. As she responded to the smiles hovering
      now about Eloise's lovely lips, she might have remembered the once sombre
      sadness of those eyes. Even Mrs. Evringham had buried the Macbethian
      dagger, and wore the meek and patient air of one misunderstood; but
      nothing would have amazed the child so much as to be told that she had had
      anything to do with this metamorphosis.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anna Belle,&mdash;deserted often now, perforce, on account of the pony,
      whose life was a strenuous one, owing to the variety of Jewel's
      attentions,&mdash;Anna Belle was petted with extra fondness when her turn
      came; and she sat at table now in a pleasing trance, her smile an
      impartial benediction upon all.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been a glorious June day, the park was at its best. After dinner
      the family strolled out toward the piazza.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Forbes had attended her own Baptist church that morning, and the
      familiar Sunday-school tune that the children sang floated through her
      mind as she looked after the group.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;When He cometh, when He cometh,
     To make up His jewels,
     All His pure ones, all His bright ones,
     His loved and His own.

     &ldquo;Little children, little children,
     Who love their Redeemer,
     Are the jewels, precious jewels,
     His loved and His own.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is Mr. Evringham going to do without that child?&rdquo; she thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker was invaded with the same problem as Jewel lingered with him on
      the piazza, while the others walked on toward a seat beneath a spreading
      maple.
    </p>
    <p>
      He ensconced himself in his favorite chair. The thrushes were singing
      vespers. The pure air was faintly and deliciously scented.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Grandpa, is it too late to bring Star out for a nibble?&rdquo; asked the little
      girl wistfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I guess not,&rdquo; returned the broker as he opened his cigar case. &ldquo;Star
      may have a short life, but he's certainly experiencing a merry one.
      There's no moss gathering on that pony.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jewel had not waited for more than the permission. She was fleeing toward
      the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham lighted his cigar, and then his eye fell upon the doll, too
      hastily set down, and fallen at a distressing angle. Her eyes were closed
      as if her sensibilities had been shocked overmuch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Anna Belle, Anna Belle, has it come to this!&rdquo; he murmured, picking up the
      neglected one, who, with her usual elasticity and exuberance of spirit, at
      once opened her eyes and beamed optimistically on her rescuer. He set her,
      facing him, on his knee. &ldquo;Such is youth!&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;When she throws you
      down, I feel that I'm not going to be so recuperative as you, Anna Belle.
      I have a plan, however, a plan of self-defense; but if it weren't for your
      discretion, I shouldn't tell it to you, for I'm an old bird, young lady,
      and can't be caught with chaff. There are many worthy persons who may rise
      to lofty heights in eternity, who nevertheless, meanwhile are not
      desirable to sit opposite a man at his breakfast table. A visit, Anna
      Belle, a short visit from my daughter Julia is all I shall ask for at
      first, and I shall test her, test her, my dear. I'll look at her through a
      magnifying glass. Of course, if they'd give me Jewel, it would be all I'd
      ask for; but they won't. That is self-evident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here the child came around the corner of the house, leading her pet by a
      halter, but with her hand in his mane as she pressed close to his side,
      caressing and talking to him. In fact it was the harassing problem of the
      pony's life to manage to avoid stepping on her. Zeke lounged in the
      background on account equally of his orders and his inclination.
    </p>
    <p>
      Star began cropping the grass, and Mr. Evringham continued his
      disquisition to the bright-eyed young person on his knee:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My son Harry is turning out a pretty good sort, I fancy. I'm not
      particularly shy of giving him a trial, provided he'll do the same by me;
      but I suppose he will have to go West at first, anyway. Julia is a
      different thing. I can't whistle her on and off with the same frankness;
      and I must be careful, Anna Belle. Do you understand? Careful! And I'm
      going to be, by Jove, in spite of the way it makes me cringe to think of
      this big house, empty as a drum. It wasn't empty before, that's the
      mischief of it. What has happened to me? I thought things were well enough
      in those days. Nobody whom I knew was particularly happy. Why should I
      be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The thrushes stopped, for Jewel's childish voice floated out on the
      evening air.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Evringham knew what had happened. He knew that Zeke had asked her to
      sing. They two were sitting on the ground, while the pony cropped away at
      the sweet grass.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;From tired joy and grief afar,
     And nearer Thee,
     Father, where Thine own children are
     I love to be!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      The broker listened for a minute.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take Jewel and her mother to the seashore somewhere; for I must
      leave the house, if only to let Madge down easily, and too, I wish to
      study Julia outside her atmosphere. Poor Madge, she's a light weight, but
      I think there are better times coming for her. At View Point she'll find
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Time passed, and at last Mr. Evringham called, &ldquo;That will do, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you want Star to go in?&rdquo; she returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      The broker nodded, and the child sprang up and began patting and smoothing
      the little horse with energetic affection.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's your bedtime, Star,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but morning's coming.&rdquo; She kissed
      his sleek shoulder. &ldquo;We'll have such a good time in the morning. I don't
      bounce a bit now, do I, Zeke?&rdquo; she asked, turning to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I guess not,&rdquo; returned Zeke scornfully. &ldquo;You ain't the kind that
      gets bounced after a fellow knows you,&rdquo; he added, smiling. He took the
      pony's halter. &ldquo;Good-night, Jewel.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Zeke.&rdquo; She ran across the lawn and up the piazza steps. &ldquo;How
      kind of you, grandpa, to amuse Anna Belle!&rdquo; she exclaimed gratefully,
      observing the doll on his knee. At the same time she most abruptly whisked
      that patient person into a neighboring chair and usurped her place.
      Cuddling down in her grandfather's arms, she nestled her head against his
      shoulder and sighed happily.
    </p>
    <p>
      The light began to fade, the last smoke from the broker's cigar curled out
      into the summer air. He tossed it away and pressed the child more closely
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sing once again the song you sang for Zeke.&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she began softly in her true, clear voice:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;From tired joy and grief afar,
     And nearer Thee,
     Father, where Thine own children are
     I love to be!&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; breathed Mr. Evringham.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /> <br />

works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
&ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
